<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Our mission, the mission of the
great Gaon, light of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, with regard to the final generation, is as
follows: “According to Rabbi Eliyahu, all <b>the steps</b>, all the
rules and details concerning the period <b>from the beginning</b> of
the Redemption until its conclusion, which include the ingathering of
exiles and settlement of the Holy Land--all these are the assignment
of the first <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>.
They derive from the <b>left side</b>, that is, from the <b>quality
of </b><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>, which
prevails <b>when the awakening</b> starts <b>from below</b>,
naturally, as occurred at the time of the Second Temple, during the
reign of Cyrus. Later on, the redemption will be completed with the
quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed </span></i>(i.e.,
<span style="font-style: normal"><b>Lovingkindness</b></span>) on the
<b>right side</b>, with <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i><b>
</b><i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i>.” </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon’s basic approach is
contained in the words <i>od Yosef Chai</i>, which means, <b>Yosef is
still alive.--</b> “As we stand on the threshold of the Redemption,
we must learn well all the 156 characteristics, aspects,
appellations, and special attributes of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. We must also study well the secrets regarding
the beginning of the Redemption that are hinted at in the holy
compositions of the Vilna Gaon--so that we shall know the way and
what will happen as illuminated by the Gaon who lights up our path
until, with God’s help, the day is established.”</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">1. As we stand on the threshold
of the beginning of Redemption (when “the songbird’s time has
arrived, ” which is the year 542 of the 6th Millennium), at the
Vilna Gaon’s behest and with his holy blessing, and with the help
of God, we are obligated to learn and understand all the paths of the
footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
and the manner of future deeds, in accord with the mission and
instructions of the Vilna Gaon. The Gaon merited being the light of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>,
in order to promote the ingathering of the exiles and to reveal the
hints in the Torah regarding the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. He was therefore sent down from Heaven [this is
based on the words, [Isa. 60:22] “<span style="font-style: normal"><b>the
smallest will become a thousand</b></span>, ” etc., and this hints
at the number 999 which is in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira
Yesod</span></i>, and the root of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">or
elyon</span></i> at the high level of the angel Metatron, who is the
Angel of Interior. All the hints about the beginning of the
Redemption and the secrets concerning the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
until and including the very end were revealed to the Gaon. He wrote
about the final end at length in his commentary on the <i><b>Sifra
Dezniuta</b></i>, adjuring others in the name of the God of Israel
not to reveal it. After many of his students had promised him
faithfully to go to Zion and begin working there on gathering in the
exiles <b>when the awakening</b> starts <b>from below</b>, with the
help of God, then the Gaon revealed to them all the steps of the
beginning of the Redemption. According to a major principle of the
Gaon that appears in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sifra
Dezniuta</span></i>, everything that was, is, and will be in all the
upper and lower worlds, as well as all the general and personal
things that will happen in every generation--all these are hinted at
in the Torah (see below, Chapter 3, for hints in holy works). </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">2. According to the Gaon, all
the work involved in gathering in the exiles, building Jerusalem and
broadening the settlement of the land of Israel so that the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>
will return to it, all the principles of the work and all the major
and minor details are connected to the mission and role of the first
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> is the miraculous power who will assist every
act done <b>when the awakening</b> starts <b>from below</b>, in a
natural manner, because he comes from the earth. <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i>, however,
will come from Heaven as revealed by the different aspects of Rachel
and Leah, and as known regarding the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
and the revealed end. <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> himself is a composite of two aspects: on the
one hand, he is Yosef the son of Rachel of the land; on the other
hand, he is Yosef son of Jacob from Heaven. It is therefore incumbent
upon us to learn and to understand all the 156 characteristics
[qualities], appellations, and all aspects and special attributes of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
(as explained below in Chapter 2). These will be a light for our feet
and direct us what to do and how, in connection with what lies ahead,
with the help of the Redeemer of Israel, may it be speedily in our
day.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">3. According to the Vilna Gaon,
if Israel does not have the merit, then the beginning of the
Redemption will occur <b>with an awakening from below</b>, as
occurred during the time of Cyrus, during the Second Temple, as an
act from the <b>left side</b>, that is, <b>from the quality of </b><i><b>Din</b></i>.
That is what is meant by “his left hand is under my head, ” which
refers to <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>.
This will occur with the permission of the kings of the nations.
Later on, the complete Redemption will come from the <b>right side</b>,
that is, with the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>,
and by the line of Mercy according to what is written, [Isa. 43:5]
“<b>and with abundant mercy I will gather you</b>.” According to
the Gaon, the ingathering of exiles at the beginning of the
Redemption will proceed by means of deliverance and ransom, as is
written, “<b>then the ransomed of the Lord will return, and come to
Zion with glad song</b>” [Isa. 35:10]. All this will be
accomplished by <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben
Yosef</span></i>: The deliverance will be from enslavement of the
body and enslavement of the soul. The word has two meanings: it
refers to the fact that they will return to Zion as is written: “they
will come to Zion.” It also refers to the fact that they will
repent [ comes from the same root as repentance] as revealed by the
words, “<b>they will achieve joy and gladness</b>.”</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">A most important principle of
the Gaon is that everything that will occur upon completion of the
Redemption will begin at the beginning of the Redemption and
gradually proceed, by the 999 footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
which are compared to the footsteps of the flock.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">4. The Gaon began revealing
secrets of the Torah when he was 20 years old in 5500 [1740], during
the first hour of the morning on Friday in the 6th millennium. Then,
the spirit of God, the spirit of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">m</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">ashiach</span></i>,
began to move in his holy spirit, to uncover mysteries in the Torah
little by little in accord with the mission of the first <i><span style="font-weight: normal">ma</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">shiach</span></i>.
These were revelations of the deep mysteries and profound secrets
associated with the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
and no secret was hidden from him [the Gaon]. As is known, the Gaon
then began traveling to the Holy Land at the beginning of the second
hour, that is in 5542 [1782]. That was the period when Rabbi Eliyahu
became very agitated. Like a storm, he turned his attention to the
ingathering of exiles.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Generally speaking, the
beginning of the Redemption, otherwise known as the <b>footsteps of
the </b><i><b>Mashiach</b></i>, began the first hour of Friday
morning in the 6th millennium, that is the year 5500 [1740], and from
hour to hour the footsteps have continued to progress from many
aspects. As is known, every hour consists of 41 years and 8 months,
counting from the time that the bonds on the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>’s
steps were loosened, as it says, [Ps. 116:16] “<b>you loosened my
bonds</b>” and as revealed in the sentence: [Ps. 81:6-7] “<b>He
appointed it as a testimony in Yosef... I have removed his shoulder
from the burden; let his hands stay away from the kettle</b>.”
Beginning with the second hour (i.e., from 5042 [1782]), the entire
House of Israel entered the picture, both as a whole, and with regard
to each individual member of the nation, as an order from above, of
the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i> of the
beginning of the Redemption, namely, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">5. Through his holy spirit,
Rabbi Eliyahu, the Vilna Gaon, knew exactly where the name and
destiny of each member of Israel were hinted at in the Torah, each
man according to the flag of his forefathers, according to the root
of his soul, and the merit of his forefathers. The Gaon knew this on
the basis of hints which he understood based on the use of gematria
[numerology, a system in which every letter of the Hebrew aleph-bet
has a numerical value] and notrikun [acrostics--a system in which
sets of letters, such as the initial or final letters of the lines,
taken in order, form a word or phrase]. He even found many hints (52
hints) regarding himself and his own great and holy mission in
connection with the ingathering of exiles (see below, Chapter 3).</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">6. According to the Gaon, Rabbi
Eliyahu of Vilna, below are the seven major principles connected with
the approach called the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
which is based on the sentence, “<b>on each stone were seven eyes</b>
[apertures]” [Zach. 3:9]:</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">a. “<b>Yosef is still alive.</b>”
The basic approach of the Gaon is encapsulated in the principle
“Yosef is still alive, ” meaning that the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> is still alive and will live, because, as it is
written, every aspect of the beginning of the Redemption is dependent
on him. Thus the decree regarding his murder by Armilus the Wicked
will be canceled. It will be canceled by extending the period of the
exile, by afflictions that the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> will suffer and diseases he will bear, and also
by deeds that he will accomplish with great devotion, such as
gathering in exiles, which is his mission. What will also help are
messianic pangs and afflictions connected with Eretz Israel, and our
regular, daily prayers for the life and success of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. Those who occupy themselves with gathering in
the exiles, lighten the afflictions of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> during the period called “the footsteps of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>.” The
decree regarding the death of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> will be nullified by subdivision into small
parts, as in the parable recounted in the Midrash. There is a parable
of a king who became angry with his son and swore to throw a big
stone at him. Afterwards, he regretted what he had said, and had
compassion on him. In order to fulfill his vow nevertheless, he broke
up the big stone into many small ones and threw all these small
stones at his son one by one. Thus the son was not killed, yet he
suffered from the small stones. These are the pangs of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>:
the suffering will come gradually, together with the 999 footsteps of
the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>, in such
a way that the decree is divided into 999 small parts. In contrast,
help will come as hinted in the sentence, [Jer. 30:7] “<b>a time of
trouble it is for Jacob</b>, ” from which he will be saved. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The general mission of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> is three-fold: revelation of the mysteries in
the Torah, ingathering of the exiles, and removal of the unclean
spirit from the land. The ingathering of exiles encompasses three
tasks: building Jerusalem, gathering in the exiles, and fulfilling
the commandments dependent on the Land. All these are hinted at in
the following sentences: [Ps. 24:3] “<b>who will ascend the
mountain of the Lord</b>, ” referring to the ingathering of exiles
[initial letters — *MBY* -- are initials of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>]. [Ps. 24:3] “<b>who will stand up in the
place of his sanctuary</b>” referring to the building [initial
letters ** -- are initials of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>]. Wherever the word “to stand up” is
mentioned, it refers to the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, as in the phrase [Gen. 37:7] “<b>my sheaf
rose</b>” [Ps. 24:5] “<b>he will receive a blessing from the
Lord</b>” refers to something that carries with it a blessing, such
as planting [the initial letters are the initials of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, though in reverse order — *YMB*. And in the
sentences [Jer 31:20] “<b>return to your cities</b>, ” “<b>build
Jerusalem</b>, ” [Ps. 102:14] “<b>it is the time to favor her</b>.”
‘To favor’ refers to planting as it states, “he will favor its
dirt.” Each one of them accords with the gematria of “<b>testimony
in Yosef</b>” that refers to <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. Also, these three tasks were given to Cyrus as
it states: “I am the Lord Who confirms the word of His servant, and
fulfills the counsel of his messengers; Who says of Jerusalem: ‘It
will be settled’... Who says <b>to the depths</b>, ‘Dry up, and I
will dry out your rivers’. Who says of Cyrus, ‘my shepherd’; he
will fulfill all my desire, ” etc. [Isa. 44:24-28]. According to
the explanation of the Gaon, the word in Gematria equals [131]
because the purpose of building Eretz Israel is to drive out from the
gates of Jerusalem. And therefore this is the mission of Cyrus as
part of the mission of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> from the left side, which means the quality of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>. The might of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
lies in the miraculous assistance he can offer in connection with the
ingathering of exiles that will come about when the awakening comes
from below. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">7. [b]. <b>Act and be
successful</b>. One of the special characteristics of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> is his successfulness when he acts, as it says
with regard to Yosef (son of Jacob), [Gen. 39:3] “<b>whatever he
did, the Lord made prosper in his hand</b>.” The following great
idea of the Gaon became known: there are only two commandments which
a person’s entire body has to enter in order to fulfill them--the
commandment of the tabernacle, and that of Eretz Israel. This is
hinted at in the sentence, “And his tabernacle was in Shalem, and
his dwelling-place in Zion, ” and the Gaon adds that the
commandment regarding tabernacles <b>requires you to ‘do, ’</b>
that is, to fulfill a positive commandment, not to take from what is
done. Likewise with regard to Zion. As it states in the Midrash on
the sentence: “a redeemer will come to Zion.” As long is Zion is
not yet built, the redeemer will not come. As Our Sages of blessed
memory said (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megillah</span></i>
17b), “after Jerusalem is built, the son of David [<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>]
will come.” According to the Midrash, the son of David will not
come until Jerusalem is built.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">8. [c] [Isa. 60:22] “<b>in
its time, I will hasten it</b>.” Our Sages interpreted this
principle to mean that, if they [the People of Israel] merit it, I
will hasten it [the Redemption]; if not, I will bring it in its own
time (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i> 98a).
Regarding this, the Gaon commented that after all, the verse should
be interpreted literally. According to the plain interpretation, even
if the Redemption comes at its proper time, I will hasten it. When?
--”when <span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">the
smallest will become a thousand</span></span> and the youngest a
mighty nation.” The words smallest and youngest refer to Efraim,
who is <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>.
It is known that the highest level of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, who will come when the awakening comes from
below, is 1000 less one, or 999 in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira</span></i>
of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Yesod</span></i>. When the
smallest one will become 1000, that is, when his deeds reach the
level just below 1000, then - I am the Lord; even in its time, I will
hasten it. This is also the meaning of “and the things that are to
come upon them, will make haste” (Deut. 32). In the words of the
Gaon (in which there is also some hint regarding his name), “there
is a time for every desire” means that determination of the time
depends on the objective below, as it says with regard to Cyrus, “and
he will fulfill all my desire.” Cyrus was given his mission in
connection with <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben Yosef</span></i> from the
left side, that is, from the side of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>
that is operative when the awakening comes from below. Many times I
have witnessed the Gaon pacing around his room, speaking agitatedly
saying, “Lord of the Universe, don’t you have a middle road
between ‘its time’ and ’I will hasten it.’” We insist on
the plain interpretation of your promise: “I am the Lord; in its
time, I will hasten it.” </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">9. [d]. ! <b>by possession and
conquest in the revealed end</b>. The fourth principle is that at the
beginning of the Redemption in our time, i.e., the final redemption
in the last generation--all activities must be in accord with one of
two lines or paths: one is the line of Ezra and Nehemia; the other is
the line of Joshua. Regarding the sentence, [Deut. 11:31] “you
shall possess it and you shall settle in it, ” Rabbi Eliyahu, the
Vilna Gaon says (in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Aderet
Eliyahu</span></i>, on Deut. 11), “Because of your merit in taking
possession of it, you will dwell in it, and how will you take
possession of it, by establishing your claim.” How does one
establish a claim? This is done by building and planting as is the
law in general with regard to possession of land. This is in line
with what was done by Ezra and Nehemia. However, when necessary,
force may also be used (in this case, there is a kametz under the
Het--meaning by force; if there is a hataf-patach under the het, it
means by establishing a claim, by possession), and this is in line
with what was done by Joshua. The Gaon showed us a wonderful hint
regarding this idea, i.e., that according to gematria ! ‘<b>Ezra</b>’
and ‘<b>Nehemia</b>’ together equal ‘<b>Joshua</b>’ [391]
Joshua was a descendant of Efraim ben Joseph, the one who fought
<b>Amalek</b>. in gematria, when counting the value of all the
letters pronounced when saying the word [that is, ], equals [490]
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>. The
mission of Joshua son of Nun, a descendant of Efraim, was to fight
Amalek. Joshua was the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, who was supposed to counterattack [lit.: bring
the war back to the gates of Jerusalem] at the entrance to the city.
Here would be the center of the war against Esau, as it says [Ps.
76:4] “<b>there he broke the flames of the bow</b>.” This mission
of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
was hinted at in the sentence above, [Ps. 76:3] “<b>his tabernacle</b>
[was / will be] <b>in Shalem and his dwelling-place in Zion</b>.” </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">By using gematria, the Gaon
discovered a hint regarding his own mission and a hint at his name in
the words “<b>his tabernacle in Shalem and his dwelling-place in
Zion</b>.” Those words equal the value of 3 generations of the
Gaon, ! “Eliyahu son of Shlomo Zalman son of Yisachar Dov” (as
explained below in Chapter 3).</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">These things ensure us that in
our war against Amalek, from every aspect our tabernacle will be
complete with the help of God. And the Gaon meant by his
interpretation of the words ! “ <b>you shall inherit it by
establishing your claim</b>, ” that this refers to the time of the
revealed end mentioned by our Sages (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>
98a; <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megillah</span></i> 17b) on
the sentence, [Ez. 36:8] “<b>you, mountains of Israel, will give
forth your branch, and bear your fruit for My People, Israel</b>,
etc.” This was the keen desire of the Vilna Gaon.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">A major principle of the Gaon
was that all activities regarding the beginning of the Redemption
have to be similar to the activities during the time of Ezra and
Nehemia and in the time of Cyrus. The Gaon wrote specifically that
ingathering of the exiles can be merited by fulfilling the mitzvot
dependent on being in Eretz Israel. The second meaning of ! is “take
possession by force” in the words of the Gaon (that is, the het
with a kametz as noted above) is, as it says (Keddushin 26a) in
accord with the sentence: [Jer. 40:10] “<b>settle in your cities
that you have taken</b>.” </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The purpose of gathering in the
exiles is to wage God’s war against Amalek, which was the main
mission of Joshua, in line with <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. The war against Amalek includes every aspect,
against all the enemies of Israel, including Armilus, the prince of

for abundance from above to reach Israel. The abundance in all the
upper special characteristics that will come by way of Zion and
Jerusalem will be evident in <b>life, salvation, blessings, peace,
</b><b>lovingkindness</b><b>, mercy, goodness</b>, etc. Such an
abundance is mentioned specifically in the following passages.
Abundance of <b>life</b>, for example, is noted in: “there the Lord
commanded the blessing of life forever” [Ps. 133:3], and in, “to
look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” [Ps.
27:133]. Abundance of <b>salvation</b> is noted in: “for from Zion
comes salvation for Israel” [Ps. 4:7]. Abundance of <b>blessings</b>
is mentioned in: “may God bless you from Zion” [Ps. 128:5], etc.,
and in: “because there the Lord commanded the blessing” [Ps.
133:3], etc. Abundance of <b>peace</b>, as in: “peace of Jerusalem”
[Ps. 122:6] and Jerusalem means the <b>city of peace</b>. Abundance
of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">chesed</span></i>, as in:
“like the dew of the Hermon that descends on the mountains of Zion”
[Ps. 133:3]. The “dew of the Hermon” refers to the attribute of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">chesed</span></i>. Abundance of
<b>mercy</b>, for God builds Jerusalem with mercy, as is written:
“Who, in his mercy, builds Jerusalem” [see Blessing after meal].
Abundance of <b>goodness</b>, as is written: “and see the goodness
of Jerusalem” [Ps. 128:5], and “this good mountain and the
Lebanon” [Ps. 128:6]. All of the above are the assignment of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>,
because Zion is in line with Yosef according to the Midrash mentioned
above. As long as Zion is desolate, a spirit of impurity prevails and
places obstacles preventing the passage of abundance from above. Only
building Jerusalem can strengthen the connection as it
states:“built-up Jerusalem is like a city united together” [Ps.

“for from Zion will the Torah come forth” [Isa. 2:3]. This refers
to the revelation of the secrets of the Torah, whose principal source
is Zion and Jerusalem. The Gaon wrote much about the fact that the
redemption depends on learning Kabbalism, for thus the teachings of
our righteous <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
will be revealed gradually, which means the teachings the Tora of
Eretz Israel (which is the the Jerusalem Talmud). This is revealed in

At the beginning of the redemption when “it is the time to favor

of the beginning of the Redemption, then hints in the Torah and in
the works of our Sages of blessed memory will begin to be revealed.
Thereby, people will begin to understand the ways of the beginning of

as is written: “the buds were seen on the land, the songbird’s

land” [Song 2:12]. Also, according to the command, “make straight
in the desert a highway for our God” [Isa. 40:3]. As explained
below in chapters 3 and 4, the Gaon came down from Heaven in order to
reveal the hints of the Torah regarding the footsteps of the

in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tsofnat Paneach</span></i>,

(see above section 9 [d], and below Chapter 3).</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">13. There are seven ways for
the beginning of the Redemption to occur in practice, with the help
of God. [a] <b>pangs and pleasure</b>. We must know beforehand that
the beginning of the Redemption will come by way of suffering and
pleasure, as hinted at in the sentence “pangs for Yosef.” It will
come with the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>
<b>when the awakening</b> starts <b>from below</b>.The <b>footsteps
of the </b><i><b>Mashiach</b></i> come with pangs, and sometimes even
indirectly. On the other hand, in contrast, the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>
is present, as it says, “he [Israel] stretched out his right hand,
and placed it on Efraim’s head.” </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">We must know beforehand, that
during the period of the footsteps of the Messiah, whenever there is
trouble, help will come, and the help will come out of the trouble,
as it states: “it is a time of trouble for Jacob; but out of it he
will be saved.” The Gaon, in his commentary on Habakkuk regarding
the verse “I will rest on the day of distress, ” states that this
sentence refers to <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben
Yosef</span></i>, and that we should know beforehand that Eretz
Israel is obtained by suffering. But in that manner it is definitely
obtained. The footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
comes with disturbances and obstacles brought on by the Angel of Esau
as well as by Armilus, the Angel of the <b>mixed multitude</b>.
Finally, however, the Angel of Esau will fall into the hands of the
Angel of Yosef--as we find in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Midrash
Tanchuma</span></i> (on the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i>
“<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Ki Tezeh</span></i>”)--with
the help of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i>, as
happened when Judah saved Yosef, and as meant by the words: “out of
the strong came forth sweetness, ” and by “He will accept the
work of our hands.” Therefore, God forbid that we retreat when
difficulties arise or when an obstacle appears to prevent us from
continuing to work. On the contrary, we must trust that out of that
obstacle, help will come to Jacob, and from the straits we will reach
the breadth [abundance] of Divine help. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">14. [b]. <b>to walk</b> [act]
<b>modestly</b>. Every act of the beginning of Redemption must be in
accord with the verse “walk modestly with your God, ” as revealed
in the words, “place it in the ears of Joshua, ” who was in line
the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>.
The word ! “in the ears of” should be taken literally, but it
also hints at something concealed. In gematria, ! equals 70.
Likewise, the word equals 70. In addition, the Gaon mentions another
hint. He quotes the verse: “the <b>secret</b> counsel of the Lord
is with those that fear him.” If we add up the letters of as
pronounced, that is, , then the total value of the letters is 366
which equals the value of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> by means of whom the ingathering of the exiles
will be accomplished. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon also commented on the
words, “it is the glory of God to conceal a thing.” In gematria,
the words “to conceal a thing” equal “you have brought the
tribes” [871].</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">With this in mind, the Gaon
directed us to call the prophecies concerning the ingathering of
exiles the ! “Vision of Zion, ” rather than “Return of the
Exiles” [lit.: return of Zion]. The vision of Zion refers to the
sentence, “visualize Zion, the city of our designated times, ”
which means that the designated time of the redemption depends on
Zion. Thus the sentence refers to the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. This concurs with what is found in the writings
of the Holy Ari of blessed memory. It also agrees with the sentence,
“to visualize the pleasantness of the Lord and seek deep
understanding in his Temple, ” as we know. See below, chapter 2,
regarding the 156 aspects of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">15. [c]. <b>little by little</b>.
We must know beforehand that the beginning of the Redemption will
come gradually, a little at a time. According to our Sages of blessed
memory (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Yerushalmi</span></i>:
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Brachot</span></i>, ch. 1), the
redemption of Israel will come about little by little, like the first
rays of light before dawn, [Micah 7:8] “<b>though I sit in
darkness, the Lord is a light to me</b>, ” and [Prov. 4:18] “<b>a
light that increases more and more until the day is established</b>.”
Therefore, one should start any deed connected with the beginning of
the Redemption, even to a small extent, as is written: [Jer. 3:14]
“<b>one from a city, and two from a family</b>.”</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon states that there is
an important rule that anything that will occur when the Redemption
is complete, will begin gradually at its beginning. This is also true
of rebuilding Jerusalem. One should begin, even with one stone.
According to what is written, [Isa. 28:16] “<b>behold I lay in Zion
a foundation stone, a tried stone</b>, ” for this stone will test
the will to rebuild Jerusalem and to enlarge the site of its tent,
and God will help us do this. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">We also asked the Gaon about
what is revealed by the words, [Gen. 33:14] “<b>I will direct it at
my slow pace</b>, ” that is, why must the beginning of the
Redemption occur slowly? If it comes when it is a time of favor on
the part of God in connection with gathering in the exiles of Israel,
is the hand of God short [is it too difficult for God] to accomplish
this task on a large scale all at once? The Gaon then explained to us
that the period of the beginning of the Redemption will come into
being if the Jews do not have the merit, which means when it does not
come because of our righteousness. In that case, if the Redemption
comes suddenly, then on the one hand it will be impossible to bear
the suffering that will come with the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>,
as explained above. On the other hand, it will be impossible to
accept the great light that will come all at once from the side of
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>. We must
understand all this beforehand in connection with the practical work
involved in gathering in the exiles.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">I asked the Gaon what to do if
in reality it would be possible physically to bring all of Israel to
Eretz Israel all at once. For so many questions and difficulties
would arise in arranging the settlement. After deep reflection upon
this question. the Gaon replied: “If it becomes possible to bring
to the Eretz Israel 600, 000 at one time, that should be done
immediately, because there is great and complete [all-encompassing]
power in the number 600, 000, and that could defeat Samael in the
gates of Jerusalem. Then the complete Redemption would come
miraculously, aided by clouds of Heaven, as it states: “<b>then the
ransomed of the Lord will return, and come to Zion with glad song,
and with everlasting joy upon their heads</b>.” According to our
Sages of blessed memory, as well as the Gaon, this verse refers to
the period of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
(Shabbat 88a). The verse includes the letters of the number <b>600,
000</b>. We know beforehand that in contrast to all the good things
that will come gradually during the time of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
according to the important rule the Gaon explained above, there will
be obstacles caused by the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i>, obstacles detailed by our Sages that will occur
during the time of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
[the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>],
God forbid. But, with the help of God, we can overcome them, as our
Prophets and our Sages have promised us, and at the direction of the
Gaon as well as with his holy blessing, at the beginning of the
Redemption by the ingathering of exiles when the awakening of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
starts from below. Gradually then, the special good attributes of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
will also appear. As is written: “open up the gates of salvation,
”“I was brought low, and he saved me, ”“out of it he will be
saved, ”“the Lord has saved his anointed” etc. All this was
said about the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben
Yosef</span></i>, a good channel that is [999] revealed in the words:
“whoever sees the letter in a dream, ” etc. And so the blessing
of E-l Shad-ai is that all of these should be matters of holiness.
All these are the assignment of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> and of the light of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> in the final generation, that is, of the light
of the Gaon whose light increases until the day is established.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">16. [d]. <b>a poor man on a
donkey</b>. If the beginning of the Redemption occurs without merit,
it will come about like a poor man riding a donkey, that is, in
poverty, both with regard to the ingathering of exiles and the
rebuilding of Jerusalem. As it states: “they will come with
weeping, and with supplications will I lead them” etc. “and
Efraim is My firstborn.” The Gaon hinted that in gematria the word
“supplications” equals <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> [566]. So it is written, “I was brought low,
and he saved me, ” which refers to <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
son of Efraim. This is what David prayed for, that <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> would not die, as explained by the Gaon in his
book “<i>Yahel Or</i>”; and with regard to building Jerusalem as
it states, “the Lord will lift Zion, and the poor of his People
will find refuge in it” etc. All this will be like the image of a
poor man riding a donkey. It will occur when the awakening of the
beginning of the Redemption comes naturally until we merit the clouds
from Heaven. </font>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">17. [e]. <b>people of truth</b>.
One of the main means for the survival of all our work, is the
establishment of a group of people of truth. According to our Sages
of blessed memory (Shabbat 119b), Jerusalem was destroyed only
because truthful men were no longer there, and so could not establish
men of truth, with integrity, in our Holy City. Without that, there
is no value to all our labor and our deeds, God forbid. This,
according to all the bases and rules that we have set up with the
help of God.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">18. [f]. <b>equal measures</b>.
The settlement of our Holy Land in general, and the construction of
Jerusalem in particular must be according to the principle of equal
[balanced / accurate] measures for everyone. According to our Sages
of blessed memory, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i> will not
come <b>until all the measures / prices are equal</b>. Yet another
interpretation by them is that <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i> will not
come until all the rates are accurately balanced (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>
98a). See the commentary of our Sages on equally measured gardens
(Baba Batra 75b; and the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tosafot</span></i>
there). This, too, is included in the assignment of the Gaon as
expressed in the verse: [Deut. 25:14] “<b>your house should not
have two different weights for measurement, a large one and a small
one</b>, ” which is immediately followed by: [Deut. 25:15] “<b>a
perfect and just weight</b> you should have.” In the last verse,
the Gaon found his name and his assignment in the Torah as is known.
The Gaon explained to us that the term “in your house” refers to
Eretz Israel, as it states: “in order that your days be long upon
the Land, etc.” Afterwards it states, “that the Lord your God
gives you.” Likewise with respect to a built-up Jerusalem: It
states, [Ps. 122:7] “peace be within your walls, ” translated by
Onkelos as “peace regarding your possessions.” For there is no
durable peace unless there is peace regarding possessions and equal
measures, as stated above. In order to carry out the intention of the
text: “every valley will be lifted up, and every mountain and hill
will be made low, ” in accord with what is written “in
righteousness will you be established, ” meaning in a way that is
just and equal for everyone, as it states, “I will make justice the
line, and righteousness the plummet [weight].” With regard to
settling Jerusalem, our Sages of blessed memory have already said
that Jerusalem was not part of the division of Eretz Israel into
districts for each tribe. Also, no house in Jerusalem should be
leased out. In chapter 6 of this work, this matter is explained in
greater detail. If this is fulfilled, then the verse ! “<b>for as
the seed of peace, the vine will give forth her fruit</b>” etc.
will be fulfilled (Zach. 8). According to our Sages of blessed
memory, the statement that Eretz Israel will give forth its fruit,
was said with regard to the revealed end (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>
98a), and this is the main foundation for the establishment of
truthful men, discussed above. Proof of this lies in the fact that in
gematria the words: equals [457]. A hint to the wise is sufficient.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">19. [g]. <b>in righteousness</b>
[also: with charity-charity is considered a deed of righteousness]
<b>will you be established</b>. Our Sages of blessed memory said
(<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i> 98a) that
Jerusalem will only be redeemed through charity, as it says [in
juxtaposition]: [Isa. 1:27] “<b>Zion will be redeemed with justice;
and those who return to her, with charity</b>.” The word <b>pidyon</b>
[redemption or ransom] is in the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. This is what the Gaon hinted at in the words
“<b>it will be redeemed with justice</b>” which in gematria is
equal to (the first <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>)
[920]. It states: “in righteousness will you be established.” The
word righteousness should be taken literally. Righteousness means
equality for everyone, as in “and I will make ... righteousness the
plummet [weight].” The plain meaning of righteousness should be
understood here, i.e., a generous contribution. It was decreed and it
is also an expression of pardon that the resettlement of Israel will
be accomplished through contributions, because God wanted to give all
of Israel--the near and the far--credit for taking part in the
building of the property of God, according to what is written: “and
gather from all of Israel silver to strengthen the House of your God
(II Chronicles 24:5) and for the building of Jerusalem.” Many other
commandments of the Torah are included and concealed here, as

Our forefathers and many of the Prophets of God, kings of Israel, and
many of the Tannaim and Amoraim, many of the great men of Israel and
the men of deeds in every generation were in the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. The first one was our forefather Abraham, as
revealed in the words, “whereby will I know that I will inherit
it?” As known, wherever the term ‘<b>inheritance</b>’ is used

inherit</b>” which in gematria equals <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach

beginning of the first Redemption</b>, that is the redemption of the
holiness from below, which is the land of the Land of Israel [Eretz
Israel]. Our forefather Isaac was in the line of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach

name even hints at *&quot;* <b>end of life</b>. Our forefather Jacob
was in the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben

which it says, “Jacob came to Shalem.” Shalem, to Succoth. Judah
was in the same line, from the time he saved Yosef; Yosef, from the
time of his first dream; Moshe Rebbeinu, from the time he took along
the bones of Yosef. Joshua son of Nun was the first who fought in the
battle of the Lord against Amalek. Both Saul and David fought in the
war of the Lord. And it is known that every war of the Lord is
considered to be in the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach

Ari and his special student, the holy and pure R. Chaim Vital, and
the Holy Rabbi, author of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Or

increases until the day will be established. A few of his students,

is significant because in gematria the value of “Yosef” is 156,

are basic aspects of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach

called God’s <b>firstborn</b>, because he is the first <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
through whom the ingathering of the exiles will occur, which means
the exodus from exile. <b>Mount Efraim</b> is so called because it
leads Israel up to Zion, as we learn from the verse: “call out from
Mount Efraim, ’Rise and let us ascend to Zion.’” The aspect
‘<b>Efraim wanders</b>, ’ signifies that <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> has no rest, he wanders from north to south, and
from south to north, as written: “wake up North, and come to the
South.” The initial letters of the 4 Hebrew words, , are equal in
gematria to the value of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> (566). “<b>Efraim is my favorite son</b>” is
the aspect ‘<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>,

the side of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>, and
always accepts influence from the right side, that is, from the
quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>.
This is the import of: “and he placed his right hand on the head of
Efraim.” We are commanded to speak of him constantly: “for
whenever I speak of him, I remember him better” (Jer: 31:20) etc.

Following the command to use a perfect and just weight, we read about
wiping out Amalek, and immediately afterwards, we find: “when you
come to the Land” [Deut. 26:1], which is similar to the verse “when
you come to the Land and plant” [Lev. 19:23], etc. All these are
thus related and of equal importance. From this the Gaon learned
about his great mission regarding the revealed end. The Gaon wrote
that “a perfect weight” is a characteristic of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>
from the left side. Only when on his way to the Land of Israel, did
the Gaon realize that he had reached the level of “faithful
shepherd” [appellation of Moshe Rabbeinu] in the verse: [Isa. 54:7]
“with abundant mercy I will gather you.” [Those words, in
gematria, equal the Gaon’s name: ! .] Therefore, the Gaon felt that
he did not have the permission of Heaven to enter Eretz Israel. He
then directed his students to act like the aspect of Joshua: that is,
to begin fulfilling the obligation of ingathering exiles. </font>

in order to separate that layer from him. When the soul of our
forefather Isaac went down into the world, a layer from the left side

separate that layer from him. The brothers thought that the center
layer had attached itself to Jacob, who is the middle line. But when
they saw that Yosef was acting in line with the traits of arrogance,
they felt certain that Yosef was the layer that had separated itself

in the case of each and every activity, general or private, carried

carry out their missions, and affect one another with their powers
and special attributes. Thus they need one another. Without the
abundance of their strength, their might, and their endowments,
Israel could not exist for even one moment, God forbid. However,
they--their powers, images, and endowments--are hidden as long as our
many sins cause Israel and the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>

apportioned differently, both with regard to levels and with regard
to influences, depending on whether the aspect of Leah or Rachel,
that is, of <i>Da’at</i> or <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i>
is involved. <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i> is the one
who causes the upper abundance to flow. <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, on the other hand, is the one who receives and
carries out what is included in the aspect of Judah saving Yosef. If
the aspect of Yosef and Judah together is involved, i.e., <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Yesod</span></i>
and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i>, then
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
causes the abundance to flow, and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i> is the
recipient. All this is true at the beginning of the Redemption, when
the wood of Yosef and the wood of Judah are “pieces of wood in your
hand, ” when they are still divided into two, on the level of the
awakening from below. At the time of the complete redemption,
however, when the two pieces of wood have become “one in My hand”
(the hand of God), then the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
will be like two inseparable friends; they will have become one, they
will have become the King <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
who is on the level of the trustworthy friend of the final redeemer,
Moshe Rabbeinu, may he rest in peace. This is on the level of the
great thousand, when God will become king over all the land, etc.
(this is affirmed in gematria: [and] together, equal 1000). Since we
are standing on the threshold of the beginning of the Redemption, we
must learn and know all the aspects and tasks of the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>,

to separate the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>.
Our main task to counter, even battle such deeds; we must destroy the
might of the mixed multitude, the layer of the wicked Armilus, and
drive them out of Israel. The mixed multitude is our greatest enemy,
for it separates the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>.
The outer shell of the mixed multitude operates only by delusions and
indirectly. Therefore the war against the mixed multitude is the most
difficult and bitter, and we must wage war against it and overpower
it with all our might. Anyone who does not participate in the war
against the mixed multitude, is actually becoming a partner of the
“layer” of the mixed multitude. Whoever he is, he would have been
better off had he not been born. The primary power of the mixed
multitude is at the gates of Jerusalem, particularly at the entrance
to the city, which is on the western middle line.</font></p>

the words: “our feet were standing in the gates of Jerusalem.”“Our

it possible to stand with a sense of security? When Jerusalem is
rebuilt like a city that has been joined together. Concerning this,
it is written: “On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed guards
for all day and all night.”“All night” includes during the
darkness of the exile. But as long as Jerusalem is desolate, the
guards have only enough strength to guard, not to wage war against
the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>. For
they guards cannot stand on the Holy Land in its destruction because
of the fastness of the outer layers of impurity. When, then do “our
feet stand”? When Jerusalem is rebuilt. Then the city is joined
together: Jerusalem of below is joined with Jerusalem of above. Their
central spot is at the entrance to the city on the middle line, to

means that the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
will prevail: that is, the wood of Yosef and the wood of Judah will
prevail on the levels of Heaven and Earth. Their levels are
determined by their actions, and their actions are determined by
their missions. An activity at the time of the awakening from below,
naturally, from the left line which is the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>,

the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
play a role in many aspects depending on their tasks, as discussed
below, and depending on the repairs entailed (?). The missions of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i> from below
and from above depend on their deeds, and the deeds depend on the
root of their souls. The two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
from below are the first involved in leaving the exile. They are the
two Hebrew midwives in Egypt, as mentioned by the Gaon in his <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tikunei
Zohar Chadash</span></i> regarding the verse: “<b>and they</b> [the
midwives] <b>let the children live</b>” because they occupied
themselves with saving Israel. Likewise in every generation there are
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i> from below
who are the forefathers of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
of the generations; their helpers belong to their categories. The two
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i> appear in
many different aspects according to their missions and deeds, each
one by his flag with the letters of his forefathers. They are “a
scepter and a lawgiver.” It was promised that “the scepter will
not leave Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet.” This means
that they appear in all generations. They are “the wood of Yosef
and the wood of Judah.” Whenever they appear, at first the wood
will be in pieces “in your hand.” Finally, they will become one
in the hand of God. They are the holy ox and holy donkey who wage war
against the impure ox and impure donkey, i.e., Ismael and Esau. They
hold fast to two hosts that are 499 from the right section and 499
from the left section, which equal 1000 minus one, like the gematria
of [999] “’the foot of an ox and donkey’, ” as revealed in

“’<b>feet of God</b>’” that are in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Netzach</span></i>

the verses containing the destiny of the Gaon during the footsteps of

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">In many of his compositions,
the Gaon discusses at length that all the internal aspects of the
holy Torah, the upper lights, the intentions of the written and oral
Torah, all the worlds, and the upper and lower creations are
concealed in hints in the Torah and in the writings of our Sages.
There is nothing that is not alluded to in the Torah; there is
nothing that is not alluded to in the Bible; there is nothing that is
not alluded to in the Mishna. Likewise, there is nothing about the
footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
that is not alluded to in the Gaon’s <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megilla</span></i><i>t
Storim</i>. All the hints are found in numbers as revealed by the
verse: in “Who brings out their hosts by number; He calls each of
them by name” [Isa. 40:26]. This means that every single creation
has its own basic number, and the destiny of each one, according to
his particular name and basic number, is hinted at in the Torah, and
revealed in deed and in numerology, i.e., in calculating the letters
of the Torah according to gematria and notrikun. Note the verse: !
[Ps. 46:9] “<b>go and visualize the acts of the Lord Who has
allotted devastation to the land</b>.” Do not read with a ‘patach
under the shin’ [meaning “Who has allotted devastation”] , but
with a ‘tsere’ under the ‘shin’ [meaning “Who has allotted
names”][See <i>Talmud Bavli</i>, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Brachot</span></i>,
7b]. Condiments to wisdom, the names are vessels that receive the
upper attributes from the world of <b>emanation</b> through the
letters that constitute the name. The letters may have significance
in their simple form, or in their filled-out form, or in the
filled-out form of the filled-out letters <i>ad infinitum</i>. The
general and particular roles of every creature and every person are
hinted at in his name as well as in the Torah according to gematria.
The Gaon, in his commentary on <i>Safra D’Tzniuta</i>, writes as
follows: “the rule is that whatever was, is now and will be till
the end--all are included in the Torah from the word “<span style="font-style: normal"><b>in
the beginning</b></span>” to “<b>before the eyes of all Israel</b>.”
Not only the general principles, but even the details regarding every
species, and details concerning each individual person are found in
the Torah, as well as whatever happens to him from the day of his
birth to the end of his days, and all his <i><span style="font-weight: normal">g</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">ilgulim</span></i>
including all major and minor details, and all the details regarding
every species of domesticated and wild animal, as well as every
living creature in the world and all grass and everything that grows
and inanimate objects, all the details are recorded regarding their
species and genders and what belongs to every species to the end, and
what will happen to them and their root. Likewise, whatever is
written about our forefathers and about Moshe and Israel--all occur
in every generation because their sparks appear in every generation,
as is known. In addition, all their deeds from Adam until the end of
the Torah occur in every generation, as is known to those who
understand. This is also true of every individual as the Gaon began
to explain through hints in the <i>Midrash HaNe’elam.</i> All of
this is included in the Torah in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i>t
“<i>Breshit</i>” until <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i>t
“<i>Noah</i>” as is written here with the help of God, ” etc. </font>

Heaven to reveal the hints in the Torah at the approach of the
footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
that is, the “designated deeds, designated times, and designated
emissaries” till the final end. According to the Gaon, these are
hinted at in gematria. We see that almost all the new interpretations
and revelations of the Gaon in his writings on Kabbalah, that amount
to thousands, are based on wonderful hints that he uncovered through
his holy spirit. Heaven granted him all this so that he would reveal
what will occur during the period of the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
if it comes at its designated time, for all of this applies when
Israel does not merit the period occurring ahead of time. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">3. Every person in Israel must
do his utmost to reach the level of the supreme numbers concealed
within his name which can be computed in gematria. These are hinted
at in the Torah in connection with the specific mission of the
individual, each person by his flag, with the signs of his
forefathers. It says regarding this: “may the might of my Lord be
magnified” [Num. 14:17], etc. As the Gaon explained (see the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tikunei Zohar Chadash</span></i>
[Tikun 74a]), this verse refers to the “<b>deed and gematria</b>”
mentioned in Lamentations (Ch. 9:10). Each person must achieve what
is concealed in the gematria of his name. Otherwise, he may have to
undergo a new gilgul to repair what he did not complete in this
gilgul, for whoever does not know the gematria concealed in his name,
will go down to the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sheol</span></i>.
The Gaon says, in his commentary on <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tikunei
Zohar Chadash</span></i>, that a person should achieve whatever is
indicated by his gematria, with the might of his hand. As it says:
“whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might” [Koh.
9:10] for there is neither deed nor gematria [calculation] in the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sheol</span></i> “grave, ”
which means that in the grave you will be unable to achieve the “deed
and gematria.” Knowing this, everyone will realize how he must
fulfill his unique mission in this world. As the footsteps of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i> approach,
more and more gematria hints appear that contain secrets of general
and private designated deeds. Indeed, “every valley will be raised,
” etc. And the gematria are condiments to wisdom as noted in the
holy <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Zohar</span></i> (<i>Tikun</i>
70), where the Gaon explained that according to our Sages, this
refers to the wisdom of scribes, etc.. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Numerology and deeds connected
with gematria are “<b>condiments</b>” to wisdom. In the word ,
which refers to the vessels, the letters [in gematria, 280] appear
twice, thus alluding to the twice 280 <i>Dinim </i>[the opposite of
<i>Chesed</i>]. The characteristic of gematria is that every
attribute of the upper lights is clothed in a particular number. The
number is found in the letters combined to form the words that
describe that particular attribute, and its purpose in the world of
<b>making</b>, the lower world; and the attribute is included in
verses of the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings. Every mission as
well as the name of the emissary in every generation are clothed and
held together by the gematria of the verses concerning the mission;
likewise regarding the name of the emissary, in accord with the root
of his soul and the merit of the fathers that is designated for each
individual. This is what is meant by the verse “<b>Who brings out
their hosts by number</b>” [Isa. 40:26], i.e., each legion has its
special number. [Isa. 40:26] “<b>He calls each of them by name</b>
[by all that is included in the name of the creature].” Happy is
the man who achieves, and reaches [that goal] by the might of his
hand and his good deeds. The purpose of “deed and numerology, ”
as explained by the Gaon, is so that a person will not fall into
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sheol</span></i>, i.e., another<i>
gilgul</i>, God forbid. Happy is he who achieves by the might of his
deeds the level of his mission that is hidden in the gematria of his
name. All this will be revealed to him in the World of Truth, but it
is preferable for one to achieve this knowledge in his lifetime, so
that he will be stronger in his special mission in this world,
because one who is commanded and fulfills the commandment stands
high. A word to the wise is sufficient. </font>

“silver goblet” [Gen. 44:2]. This is what is meant by the verse:
[Isa. 56:5] “<b>I will give them a hand and a name in my house and
within my walls</b>.” This refers to deed and gematria, as
explained above. “A hand” refers to the “might of Your [God’s]
hand”; “a name” refers to the gematria of the name of anyone
who occupies himself with building Jerusalem. Thus all the main
intentions with regard to building Jerusalem are concealed in
gematria according to our Sages. See their comments (<i>Baba Batra</i>
75b) on the verse ! “<b>Jerusalem will be settled without walls</b>”
[Zach. 2:8], and on the matter of , etc. All these are hinted at in
gematria, as the Rashbam explains there [in the future, God will add
gardens to Jerusalem, numbering a thousand times the numerical value
of 169] [<i>Baba Batra</i> 75b]. My heart tells me clearly that had I
been born only to understand what the Gemara means here, it was

“<b>disclosing the hidden</b>, ” i.e., revealing what is
concealed. To many of his students--in whom he saw clear signs of
worthiness, and who had a keen desire to immigrate to Israel--he
revealed the main hints regarding “designated deeds, times, and
emissaries” on the paths of the beginning. The Gaon did this
especially to anyone he considered as having reached the high level

nevertheless had to have his name hinted at in a concealed manner,
just like every person of Israel appears in a concealed manner, and
according to the gematria of his name. The name Moshe is hidden in
the verse: [Gen. 6:3] “since he is human.” According to Rashi

his student, Rabbi Haim Vital. These were revealed to the Gaon in the

the prophecy “every valley will be raised” will be fulfilled, and

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">7. With regard to every man of
Israel who was destined by Heaven to save Israel and gather in the
exiles, Rabbi Eliyahu, the Vilna Gaon, knew well where his name was
hinted at in the Torah, the Prophets and the Writings, each man
according to his flag and the signs of his forefathers. All the
Gaon’s knowledge which came to him through his holy spirit, are
based on holy hints in the Bible and in the works of our Sages, in
both what is revealed and what is concealed. Regarding himself, the
Gaon said that his name is hinted at in the words: “‘<b>a perfect
and just stone</b> [weight]” (this is at the end of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i>t
“<i>Ki Tetzeh</i>”). The words are a shortened form of (the name
of the Gaon’s father was ! ). The following verse speaks of
destroying Amalek, and is immediately followed by the verse: “<b>when
you come to the land</b>, ” which refers to the ingathering of the
exiles. This verse is comparable to “<b>when you come to the land,
you will plant</b>, ” which means you must fulfill the commandments
that depend on living in Eretz Israel. For the ingathering of the
exiles depends on the blessings following the fulfillment of both
verses according to our Sages in the Talmud (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megillah</span></i>
17b; and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>
98a) regarding the revealed end, and this was the Gaon’s great
aspiration. Even in the haftarah [portion from the Prophets or
Writings which is read weekly following the reading of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i>]
of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">t</span></i>
“<i>Ki Tetzeh</i>, ” the Gaon found his own name and his
designation in the verse: “<b>with abundant mercy I will gather
you</b>” which equals ! [606]. He also found that the verse “<b>His
tabernacle is in Shalem, and his dwelling in Zion</b>” equals his
own name plus his father’s and grandfather’s names ! [1200] {the
word as written out in full in the text, and so counted accordingly).
This means that Jacob is not whole except in Eretz Israel. As the
verse states: [ Gen. 33:18] Jacob came to Shalem [double entendre:
name of place, and meaning of wholeness]. Shalem is another name for
Succota. </font>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Vilna Gaon deemed his great
mission to be connected with 999 in the light of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach

that is 999 which is the highest number connected with <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>. For the Gaon considered that number hinted at
in his name (that is, in his personal name as well as those of his
forebears to four generations including his great-grandfather, R’
Elya the Hasid [*' ' '*] which altogether equal 999 in gematria).
Other hints regarding his mission appear in the verses: [606, like !
] ‘a time to gather, ’ and according to our Sages [606] ‘we
raise to a holy level, ’ as well as in the verse: [479, like ] [Ps.
102:15] ‘they have favored her dirt.’ Many other hints were found
by the Gaon in the Bible regarding his holy mission at the time of
the beginning of the Redemption. The number of holy hints add up to
[52]. Evey hint was great and holy in his eyes like the <i>Urim
v’Tumim</i>. As our Sages said “the name causes, ” meaning that
one’s mission from Heaven is revealed by his name. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">8. As is known, the Gaon saw
his great mission in the verse: “the voice of the turtle-dove.”
It appears in the verse: “the songbird’s time has arrived; the
voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.” The ‘voice’ of
the turtle-dove refers to Joshua. The ‘turtle-dove’ is Moshe
Rabbeinu (as mentioned above in Chapter 2, 14, the aspect of ‘the
voice of the turtle-dove’.At first the Gaon considered himself from
the aspect of Joshua, as is hinted at in the Torah on the verse “a
perfect weight” (end of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i><i>t
</i>“Ki Tetzeh”), referring to **. Following this verse is the
section on destroying Amalek, which is the mission of Joshua, that
is, from the left side. Thus this is the mission of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> (see commentary of the Gaon on <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tikunei
Hazohar</span></i>, p.27 on the verse, [Song 2:6] “<b>his left hand
under my head</b>.” The Gaon also writes that the perfect weight is
from the left side (that is, from the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>).
Immediately after the verses on Amalek, the Torah speaks of coming to
the land of Israel. Since the Gaon then considered himself to be from
the side of Joshua, that is from the aspect of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, he traveled to the Holy Land. However, on the
way, he rose to the level of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tiferet</span></i>, the level of
Moshe Rabbeinu, may he rest in peace. Then the Gaon saw his name
hinted at in a verse that refers to Moshe Rabbeinu, may he rest in
peace: [Isa. 54:7] [606] “‘with abundant mercy I will gather you”
and realized that the gematria of the verse equals that of his name [
*!* equals 606] (see section 7 of this chapter). Likewise : in
gematria equals 606. Therefore, the Gaon thought that he did not have
permission to enter Eretz Israel; he could only transmit to his
students, as Moshe did to Joshua, that they, from the aspect of
Joshua, should begin gathering in the exiles. This is “the Lord’s
war against Amalek from generation to generation” [Ex. 17:16]. The
Gaon gave one of his students the wonderful hint that the verse:
hints at his name to three generations, and likewise the words offer
a hint.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon was born in 5480 in
the 6th Millennium. He considered this hinted at in the verse: “and
Miriam took [gematria: 5480--the  ** is considered 5000] ‘the drum’
in her hand” [Ex. 16:20] against the “<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i>.” The mission of the Gaon is hinted at in the
Torah in the words “a perfect weight” in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i><i>t</i>
“Ki Tetseh”, which means the 6th hundred of the 6th Millennium.
The Gaon became the light of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
when he was 20 years old in the year 5500, the first hour of the dawn
in the 6th Millennium. Then the last generation began. Afterwards, he
merited a revelation from our forefather Jacob, and profound secrets
were revealed to him regarding all the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
from the beginning of the Redemption up till and including the
wondrous end at the end of days. </font>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon saw in his divine
transmission that he had risen to the level 999 in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Yesod</span></i>
and that its abundance, the abundance of good is divided into two
hosts equally. There are 499 1/2 on the right, and 499 1/2 on the
left. Together they add up to 1000 minus one, which is the channel of
good, the highest force for war against the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i>. The Gaon wrote about this and the great hints
regarding his name, when he discussed the Hebrew alphabet (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Likutei

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">9. Nothing exists that is not
hinted at in the Torah and in the Mishna. Every spiritual or material
creation as well as his mission, whether holy or impure is found
there. This is what is meant by our Sages (<i>Chulin</i> 139b) that
Moshe Rabbeinu, the holiest of the created beings, was hinted at in
the Torah; in contrast, Haman, the most impure being is also hinted
at. Similarly, all the major and minor details of every creation, and
concerning every person according to the signs of his forefathers as
well as according to his accepted name, appear among the numerous
hints in the Bible and in the works of our Sages.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">It is an important principle
regarding hints in notrikun and in gematria that the one hinted at
must appear in a word or particular verse in the Bible or in our
Sages’ writings exactly as his name is written. Any hint that
depends on a verse with a composite of words whose form is not
exactly like what appears in the Bible or in our Sages’ words, is
valueless as a holy hint. This principle applies to the basis of
hints by the recorder and maintainer, in the Bible or in our Sages’
words: each item must appear in its exact language and exactly how it
is written. However, whatever concerns the one hinted at, i.e.,
whether matter or person, can also appear according to the name
accepted by the community--whether a matter of holiness or an
everyday matter is involved, for the voice of the multitude is like
the voice of the Almighty.</font></p>

root above with his name according to the root of his soul and the
merit of his forefathers. As is known, the name given a child at his
birth is not given by chance; rather, the name is placed in the mouth
of his father by Heaven according to the root of his soul. No one has
less than seven numbers, all of them hinted at in the Bible or in the
Talmud, sometimes in both as revealed in the deed and in gematria.
This is explained by the Gaon in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tikunei
Zohar Chadash</span></i>. The seven numbers, revealed in the verse
“each stone has seven eyes [apertures], ” come to a man on his
flag in signs of his father’s house (for example: Yosef ben Jacob,
Yosef ben Rachel, Yosef ben Yaacov and Rachel, Yosef ben Jacob ben
Isaac, Yosef ben Jacob ben Isaac, ben Abraham, Yosef’ ... in
combination with the name of his family, or Yosef’ ... in
combination with the name of his work, or as called by the people).
All these belong to the one hinted at, that is recorded with the
numerical value on the part of the one who hints and records everyone
found in the Bible and in the Talmud, as mentioned above.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The source of the sources for
the basic numbers is the first 10 creations, the ten <i>sefirot</i>,
each of which was founded on a basic independent number. Therefore,
each is called a <i>sephira</i> as revealed in the word . They are
the first mentioned by the verse [Isa. 40:26] “Who brings out their
hosts by number, ” as is known. This is true of every matter
concerned with combining letters with which the Heaven and Earth were
created.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon was known to be
precise regarding everyone’s name, as mentioned in the Talmud in
connection with Reb Meir (<i>Yoma</i> 83b) regarding an innkeeper
named , whose name is reminiscent of the verse: **, etc. [Deut.
32:20] “for they are a deceitful generation, ” etc. It seems that
Reb Meir felt that a layer of Amalek had been attached to the
particular man, since in gematria Amalek equals [240], because Amalek
works through deceit, as is known. This is what I [the writer of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Kol
HaTor</span></i>] witnessed: Once, the Gaon realized that a strange
depression had taken hold of one of his students. He asked him what
his family name was, and was told that it was Mallin. Then the Gaon
requested that he immediately change his name since in gematria it
equaled [131] Samael. At times a great righteous person who carries
out many deeds has within his name one of the numbers similar to the
number of the impure forces from the aspect of “God made one in
contrast to the other.” Our Sages explained that this was done so
that the force of holiness would overpower the contrasting force of
impurity, just like the number of counters the number of Samael and
his partner, Lilith [**] and [611], or like counters [376]. There are
other such examples, as is known.</font></p>

words (because the name of the Vilna Gaon’s father was *!* ), and
this was his reply: “In what remains after the initial letters of
the two names in , you will find it.” I immediately understood that
he meant that the initial letters of **, that is **, contain the hint
of the names **; what was left after the two letters were removed,
i.e.**, the letters and equal *!#* [127]. He answered me in this way

These are enumerated above in Chapter 2 with the help of Heaven. Only
if there is a difficult question related to the community in matters

of the great secret destiny, according to the Gaon, the destiny (**),
“<b>open for me the gates of righteousness</b>, ” that is based
on treasures concealed in gematria and notrikun, as revealed in in
gematria. A secret name should not be used except at a critical time,

because the Torah will come forth from Zion [Isa. 2:3], meaning that
hidden things and secrets will be revealed, may this occur speedily
in our lifetime. According to the Gaon, It is an important principle
that a literal interpretation is not correct if it does not accord
with the secret interpretation. Studying the Kabbalah should be done
with modesty and humility, as attested to in the verse: [Ps. 29:2]
“<b>bow to the Lord in the beauty of holiness</b>.” The initial
letters (from left to right--i.e., in reverse order, [thus somewhat

the impure spirit from the land by settling the land and setting up
people of Truth. For the goal of the Redemption in general is the
redemption of Truth and sanctification of God as explained in
previous chapters. Redemption of the truth has a double entendre --
literally, and the redemption of the wisdom of truth. This enhances
the commandment and holy obligation to engage in studying the

years old, he also learned a lot about the concealed teachings from
great men in our community of Shklov, relatives of his father, his
great grandfather R’ Shlomo Zalman, son of R’ Zvi, as well as
from R’ Eli Zeitlis. He especially engaged much in the study of

directly from his holinesss, he did so in order to achieve and know
how to create raw power with the help of God --- to use it to subdue
Samael in the gates of Jerusalem. That is why he began as far back as
his childhood an awesome attempt to create a Golem [automaton of
clay], as is known. </font>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">I will tell you a little, as
much as we are permitted to tell, about a sublime vision, a wonderful
sight, that the Gaon envisioned shortly after returning from his trip
to the Holy Land in the year 5542. The Gaon was then very deeply
concerned and in a spiritual quandary that is difficult to describe.
On the one hand, he saw with his holy spirit the great mission that
Heaven had placed on him to awaken and begin actively gathering in
exiles. On the other hand, he saw the awful dangers entailed, both in
travelling to the Holy Land, and in the conditions of settling --
when Eretz Israel was a desolate wilderness where contagious diseases
prevailed, and where robbers and savages abounded. There were also
the problems of obtaining necessities, such as economic necessities,
and of earning a living. Naturally, this was a great responsibility.
He was so deeply perplexed that we had never seen him like that. He
prayed alot while fasting and crying, hoping to receive clear advice
from Heaven. He also carried out many acts with secret emendations,
etc. Indeed, he received a reply in a great and holy vision with
revelations of upper spirits, a revelation of our forefather Jacob
regarding “the final days, ” etc. (note of the copyist: at this
point, we must mention that the Gaon, Rabbi Chaim from Volozhin, a
student of the Vilna Gaon, writes in his introduction to the Vilna
Gaon’s commentary on <i>Safra D’Tzniuta</i>, that the Vilna Gaon
received a revelation of our forefather Jacob and Elijah the
Prophet). In that holy vision, he was told many verses containing
beneficial promises concerning settling Eretz Israel, and containing
hints of his own name. Among the latter were: [Isa. 44:2] “<b>fear
not, My servant Jacob, and Yeshurun, whom I have chosen</b>.” It
was hinted to him that the words equal his name including 3
generations: *!* [1200]. This was the first time the Gaon saw his own
mission in the great mission of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
of the beginning of the Redemption, for in gematria equals [566]*.
Likewise the verse: [Ps. 76:3] “His tabernacle in Shalem, and his
dwelling in Zion” equals [1200] (this is discussed at length in
chapters 2 and 3.) At the end of that chapter in Isaiah (44), in
which the Gaon saw his mission in the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> in the verse , the mission of Coresh is also
discussed: [Isa. 44:28] “Who says of <i>Coresh</i> (Cyrus), ‘he
is My shepherd, ’” etc. The Gaon wrote that the beginning of the
Redemption comes as part of his mission. This sublime vision
encouraged and strengthened the Gaon’s heart. From then on, he was
no longer disturbed by the doubts concerning the natural difficulties
and dangers that he had worried about beforehand. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">With this revelation, it was
agreed to transmit to the Gaon the sublime mission of returning the
five <i>vauvim</i> that our forefather Jacob had removed from the
name of the prophet Eliyahu [the name was spelled five times] as a
guarantee that he would come to announce the Redemption of his
children, as brought in the Midrash. At first, the five <i>vauvim</i>
were small, because every filling in is from the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>,
like the beginning of the Redemption which is the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>.
The Gaon was thereby given the power to prepare the way for the
beginning by gathering in the exiles to complete the first part, as
it is written [Mal. 3:23] “<b>behold I am sending you Elijah the
prophet</b>, ” etc. This mission of the Gaon was hinted to him at
the time also in the verse [Deut. 25:15] “a perfect and just stone
[weight], ” which contains the Gaon’s name , as is known from the
secret of , which equals [52] when no letter is missing. After the
Gaon returned from his trip to the Holy Land, since he did not have
permission from Heaven, as is known, he transmitted his authority to
one of his students, who was hewn from the same rock [who was of the
same root] as himself, and whose name was equal to five times ‘<i>vau</i>’
[% i.e., 13x5**] on the level of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> for the time
being. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">It has been said that the Gaon
travelled from place to place to make himself an exile. However, his
travelling has not been interpreted properly. The Gaon’s aim was
primarily to check on what his People were doing and how they were
behaving morally. As the Gaon wrote, man was created to subjugate
evil qualities, and to repair himself and others in accord with the
holy Torah. Indeed, wherever the Gaon went, he did not reveal himself
to anyone, but hid his identity so that he would appear as a simple
member of the Jewish People. However, before leaving a place, he
revealed something about himself to the Rabbi of the community and to
special people in the place. He admonished them to correct whatever
moral deeds or Torah commandments, or other good deeds needed
improvement in that particular community. Along with this, he would
rouse the people very much in connection with preparing for the
ingathering of the exiles with many explanations that “it is the
time to favor her, for the designated time has come” [Ps. 102:14],
etc.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon revealed to all of his
students who promised him faithfully to travel to the Holy Land and
to focus on settling the Holy Land, the secrets regarding the paths
of the beginning of the Redemption as revealed in “designated
deeds, times, and emissaries” as is written “the buds were seen
on the land” [Song 2:12] with holy hints concealed in the words of
our prophets and our Sages. But the great secret concerning the final
end, the end from the right that the Gaon speaks about at great
length in his <i>Safra d’Tzniuta</i>, and made his students swear
in the name of the Lord, God of Israel, that they would not reveal
it, -- this secret he revealed in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to some of his
students who promised faithfully to travel to the Holy Land and
occupy themselves in gathering in the exiles. The secret of the End
of Days, the beginning of the wonderous end, he revealed to one who
was hewn from the same rock as himself. Other hints regarding this
matter--as much as we are permitted to talk about, and which are
revealed in the manner of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tsofnat
Paneach</span></i>--will be discussed, with the help of God in
Chapter 5, as it says, “everything has its season, and there is a

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">This chapter presents the goal
of the Redemption: the Redemption of Truth and sanctification of God
leading to the repair of the world in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i>
of the Almighty. -- The triple cord--the “designated deeds, times,
and emissaries”--come together in a tripartite campaign. The
designated emissaries begin carrying out the designated deeds,
thereby hastening the designated times. This is alluded to in the
verses: “the buds were seen on the land, the songbird’s time has
arrived, the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land” [<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Song
of Songs</span></i>, 2:12]; “it is the time to favor her when the
designated time comes” [Ps. 102:14], “when your servants have
cherished her stones, and favored her dirt” [Ps. 102:15]. We must
learn to comprehend how to combine these three basic principles. To
the extent we hasten the Redemption, by cherishing her stones and
favoring her dust, the Redemption will hasten toward us. This is
revealed by the words “when the designated time comes, ” as well
as by the verse: “return to me, and I will return to you” [Mal.
3:7]. Accordingly, holy hints about the <b>designated times of
remembrance</b> and revealed end are disclosed to us in the last
generation that extends to the final end, the concealed end.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">According to our Prophets and
the Gaon’s explanations, the goal of the Redemption is the
Redemption of Truth and sanctification of God; the purpose of our
activity in general is to wage war against Armilus by gathering in
the exiles and settling the Holy Land, for that is what will redeem
the truth and sanctify God. This is what Isaiah means by the words
“He has redeemed Jerusalem” (52:9), which is called the City of
Truth [Zach. 8:3]. The Redemption of Truth can occur only after
destroying the klipah shell/ layer of Esau that appears in the form
of Armilus, the epitome of the truth-hater. Esau hates Jacob, the
epitome of truth, as indicated in the statement “you will grant
truth to Jacob” [Micah 7:20]. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The goal of the redemption of
truth is sanctification of God. This was implied by the Gaon in the
order of a number of verses he cited. First, “with their eyes they
will see the return of God to Zion” [Isa. 52:8], means that the
exiles will be gathered in. Then the prophet calls out: “burst out,
sing joyfully together, O ruins of Jerusalem” [Isa. 52:9], which
apparently refers to the rebuilding of Jerusalem and ridding it of
the odor of impurity. The joy is because “the Lord has comforted
His People; He has redeemed Jerusalem” [Isa. 52:9]. These words
relate to the redemption of truth, for Jerusalem is called the City
of Truth. This statement is followed by: “God has uncovered His
holy arm before the eyes of all the nations” [Isa. 52:10], which
refers to sanctification of God. The verse alludes to Israel’s
victory in the War of Gog and Magog, through <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> who, according to the Gaon, will appear
following the first redemption from the oppression of the kingdoms,
with the great force revealed in the words that God is truth and His
seal is truth. Then “all ends of the earth will see the salvation
of our God” [Isa. 52:10], which is a reference to the revelation of
our righteous <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben
David</span></i>. The sanctification of God in the eyes of the
nations will affect the sinners of Israel, and they will repent of
their evil ways. When they see that the other nations recognize the
power God has given his people, they will be embarrassed and return
to God with recognition, thereby sanctifying God. This is what is
meant by the verse regarding the return of the captivity of Zion:
“then among the nations it will be said, ‘the Lord has done great
things for them.’” “The Lord has done great things for us”
[Ps. 126:2-3]. In the future, after the other nations recognize the
great deeds that God has done for the People of Israel, then the
entire nation of Israel, even those of little faith, will say, “The
Lord has done great things for us.” The purpose of the Redemption
of the Truth and sanctification of God is to unify the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>,
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben
David</span></i>, the wood of Yosef and the wood of Judah, like the
union of the Holy One blessed be He and the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>.
The purpose of the union of the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
is to repair the world in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i>
of the Almighty.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Practically, these are the
principal paths for action during the beginning of the Redemption
when the awakening starts from below:</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">1. a) <b>gathering in the
exiles</b>; b) <b>rebuilding Jerusalem</b>; c) <b>eradicating the
impure spirit from the Land</b> by planting the Holy Land and
fulfilling the commandments that depend on living in Israel, which is
connected with the revealed end; d) <b>redeeming Truth</b> by setting
up people of Truth; e) <b>sanctifying God</b>; f) ! <b>revealing the
mysteries of the Torah</b>; g) <b>repairing the world in the </b><i><b>Malchut</b></i><b>
of the Almighty</b>.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">2. There is a great principle
in work involved in the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
that all three main principles--“designated deeds, times, and
emissaries”--must converge in a threefold cord that does not tear.
This refers to the deeds, times, and messengers alluded to in the
verse, “the buds were seen on the land, the songbird’s has
arrived, the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.”“The
buds were seen” refers to the deeds; “the songbird’s time”
refers to the designated times; “the voice of the turtle-dove”
refers to the emissaries. Similarly, in the verse, “it is the time
to favor her, for the designated time comes when your servants have
cherished her stones, and favored her dust” [Ps. 102:14-15].
Similarly, is the verse, “there is a time for everything” [Koh.
3:17], means that the time has come according to Israel’s desire at
the time of the awakening from below. Likewise, the verse “I am the
Lord; in its time, I will hasten it” [Isa. 60:22] means that when
the time comes, God will hasten the process. When will this occur?
Immediately after the smallest one has become a thousand, as
explained below in Chapter 5. We must observe, and do whatever we can
to help “the one who favors man with knowledge, ” as said by our
Sages and according to the Gaon. We must utilize holy hints and all
our ability in “deed and gematria” to compare and completely
unify all three foundations in quantity and quality in levels and
values, and strive to understand how to combine the three basic
principles with the help of the Rock of Israel and its Redeemer.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">3. The beginning of anything,
whether great or small, connected with the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
must be by the designated people, that is, the emissaries, messengers
of the Above at the beginning of the Redemption, which will occur
with designated deeds, designated activities. The two together will
hasten the designated times, that is, the times of the ends of the
footstep levels (which number 999 in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira
Yesod</span></i>) that are connected with the beginning of the
Redemption when the awakening comes from below. The emissaries will
begin the deeds and hasten the designated times. This is attested to
in the verse “you will have mercy on Zion for it is the time to
favor her, when the designated time comes” [Ps. 102:14]. When will
this be? “when your servants have cherished her stones and favored
her dust” [Ps. 102:15], then “the other nations will fear the
name of the Lord, and all the kings of the Earth Your glory, for the
Lord God will have built Zion and be seen in his glory” [Ps.
102:16-17]. Our sages in the Jerusalem Talmud and in <i>Tosefot Yom
Tov</i> revealed that the Redemption will begin, as in the days of
<i>Coresh</i>, just like the Second Temple, with the permission of
the kings of the nations. The Gaon comments that the verse “he will
fulfill all my desires” [Isa. 44:28] refers to the revealed end
mentioned by our Sages. When will this occur? It will occur when the
voice of the turtle-dove is heard and the buds are seen on the land.
(*without the permission of the nations, Jacob wrestling with Esau)</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">What will hasten the designated
time? It is possible to hasten deeds, but how can one hasten a
designated time that is determined beforehand? In the 6th millennium
- - - referred to as “a time, a time and a half” [Dan. 12:7],
which signifies every period of time according to its designated
activity (?), and ‘the half’ to ‘half’ and so on. For
whenever a deed is done when the awakening comes from below, the
quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i> on the
left side will be aided by the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>
from the right side, as explained below. Thus every designated time
will be cut in half, and this is what is meant by “when the time
comes.” It means we will not have to go as far as the designated
time, rather will the time come to us after “your servants have
cherished her stones and favored her dust.” And it will be
completed from the middle line, with the quality of mercy by way of
the middle column as stated at the beginning of the verse: “you
will have mercy on Zion” [Ps. 102:15], etc. Similarly, the Midrash
on the verse, “a redeemer will come to Zion” [Isa. 59:20] denotes
that the coming of the Redeemer depends on the rebuilding of Zion.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
“<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Everything has its season,
and there is a time for every desire” [Koh. 3:1]. According to the
Gaon, the season and time accord with the desire, and that is what is
meant by “every desire.” In the Talmud we note four sections
regarding the mode of Redemption: a) If the people repent, they will
be saved; otherwise, they will not be. b) If they do not repent, God
will place a king over them whose decrees are harsher than those of
Haman; so the Jews will repent and be saved. c) The redemption will
come at first by the return of the captivity of Zion, even if there
is only “one from a city or two from a family” [Jer. 3:14],
according to Reb Yehoshua. This is what is meant by the Revealed End.
d) The Redemption will come in any case at its designated time, which
is referred to as “the concealed end.” However, beforehand one
must consider that all of the views expressed are those of the Living
God. Therefore the Gaon told us that we must progress and select the
mode that is within our power, that is, the third mode. Should we
accomplish this and fulfill this mode, then there will be no need for
our Sages’ warnings regarding harsh decrees. Since the fulfillment
will stimulate general repentance, there will be no need to set up a
king whose decrees are harsher than Haman’s decrees. The revealed
end will thus hasten the culmination of the Redemption.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Regarding the view that all
ends have ended, this refers to the designated times during which
designated deeds by designated emissaries were not carried out, as
explained above. a Regarding the statement that the bones of those
who try to figure out the ends should swell, this refers to those who
compute the figures without considering the deeds that are necessary
when the awakening comes from below. They do not take into
consideration the beginning that comes with the first <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>,
in order to prepare the way for the great redemption by deeds. The
term “bones” is used to indicate that such people sin against the
“bones of Yosef” which contain the mystery of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> as revealed in the verse: “Moshe took the
bones of Yosef with him” [Ex. 13:19]. Should we hasten the
Redemption, by cherishing her stones and favoring her dust, then the
Redemption will come closer, as revealed in the verse: “when the
time comes, ” and as is written: “return to me and I will return
to you. -- To this extent the holy hints about the designated times
and the revealed end will be disclosed to us in the final generation
which will reach the final end, “the wondrous end” [Dan. 12:6],
until the end of the days when the blessing will be completed as
indicated by the verse: “his right hand on Efraim’s head” [Gen.
48:17]. Some of this matter is revealed through “explaining what is
hidden.” In the following chapter, with the help of God, we will
discuss this matter to the extent we are permitted to reveal the
hints. </font>

beginning of the Redemption within the three foundations, “designated
deeds, times, and emissaries, ” must proceed and be accomplished
till the final level of the awakening from below, which is the level
of 999 in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira Yesod</span></i>,
the level of 1000 minus 1. They must not recede, God forbid, due to
some difficulty or stumbling block. This is all the more so on the
last levels where the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> becomes more powerful, for in order to counter the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>’s
power, in accord with a clear and promised accounting, the miraculous
holy force, the upper abundance, salvation and success become more
powerful (see below). It is an important rule that whenever a
religious commandment is carried out, and whenever a prayer is
uttered, a man should think about unifying himself with, and binding
himself to the intentions of two hosts, the Lord of Hosts and the God
of hosts, i.e., <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>
and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>, and he

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">As noted above, all the work
involved in gathering in the exiles is in preparation of setting up
and “maintaining people of truth, ” in order to reach the level
of redemption of the truth and sanctifying God and repairing the
world in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i>
of the Almighty that is the goal of the complete Redemption. For
without the existence of people of truth, there is no hope, God
forbid, for all the work involved in the beginning of the Redemption.
As written, “Jerusalem was destroyed because people of Truth were
missing from it” [<i>Talmud Bavli, Shabbat</i> 119b]. The level of
truthful men comes only following the Interpreter’s seven repairs
not only in thought and unification of secret intentions, but also in
the integration of the repair of related deeds.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">My revered father, author of
<i>The Burden of Benyamin</i>, who understood the secret of the
“silver goblet, ” defined the repairs according to their plain
interpretation as well. In addition, he explains at length that the
main place for the repairs is in Jerusalem and its gates, the site of
the main battleground for God’s war against Amalek. Each repair
must reach the final level of the awakening from below, that is 1000
minus 1, or 999 in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira
Yesod</span></i> as is known. That is the highest number of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> as meant by the verse: “<span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">the
smallest will become a thousand</span></span>, ” etc. These are the
definitions:</font></p>

There must be equality of measurement in the two hosts: “their
feet, a straight foot” [Ez. 1:7], 499 1/2 on the right, and 499 1/2
on the left, etc. This is also true regarding deeds between man and
his fellow man in order to set up people of Truth on the median line.

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">According to the plain meaning,
equality means that each person must equate himself to the other
members of his community. He must not regard himself as superior or
greater than others, neither materially nor spiritually. This is what
is meant by the verse in the Talmud “<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben David</span></i> will not
come until all measurements are equal”; (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>

A person must elevate himself spiritually and by performing good
deeds, with the assistance of the might and secret of “Metatron,

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">According to the plain meaning,
elevation means that each one must elevate himself and rise up from
the level of animals and low materialism. He must elevate himself and
rise spiritually with regard to his virtues, emotions, and education,
because a person who remains stagnant, that is, who does not strive
to rise spiritually and raise himself with superior achievements is
likened to an animal and, like wide beasts, is liable to commit any
evil deed, God forbid.</font></p>

inclusiveness, as well as by the verse “Out of Zion, the
all-encompassing beauty” [Ps. 50:2]. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The plain meaning is
inclusiveness ** being included within the community. The individual
has only what the community has: “all of Israel is responsible for
one another.” Each person is part of the community. Nothing in
Israel is separate and personal in all aspects, whether it involves
improving the community or helping others. Likewise, regarding
reproving one another, for as it says, “Jerusalem was destroyed
only because people did not admonish one another” [<i>Talmud Bavli,

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The plain meaning is
purification (or sanctification) ** purification from the tendency
toward natural lusts that destroy the body and soul; purification
from impure thoughts and the like. One should strive for a pure
spirit that leads to the holy spirit.</font></p>

new ideas or interpretations</b>, ” revealed by the verse: *!*
“this month is for you” [Ex. 12:2] [the word can be read as
‘month’ or as ‘new’]. The new ideas concern what is revealed
and what is concealed in the Torah. They are revealed in 999 in the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira Yesod</span></i>, and in
the mystery of: “the letter ** tet’ is a good sign, ” that is
found in three worlds. The word appears at the beginning of the Torah
in connection with light. It is related to the statement that there
will be “a new light” over Zion, and to the verse “for from
Zion the Torah will go forth” [Isa. 2:3] ** that is, the teachings
of our righteous <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The plain meaning is that the
new ideas concern the period after the levels mentioned. Then
everyone must offer new explanations for what is written in the Torah
and perform additional good deeds, for every member of Israel has a
special task in this world: to reveal new interpretations of the
Torah and to add and create good activities on behalf of the
community as revealed by his “deeds and gematria.”</font></p>

Overcoming all the forces of Amalek with the force of “the angel of
hosts”“at the head of the people” [Deut. 20:9], and to
disregard the muddy valley. “When Moshe lifted his hand” then
Israel was victorious, and Aaron and Hur, who were in the line of the
two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>,
supported Moshe.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The plain meaning of overcoming
is that one must overcome the general impure spirit. Whoever has
already merited rising to all the previous levels, has the strength
to overcome the impure forces, not only in a defensive war, but also
in a wave for “the defense of Israel.” He can destroy the impure
spirit, the evil spirit of Amalek, and eradicate it from the midst of
Israel. The evil inclination and all the vices must be completely
overcome.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Repair 7. “<b>unity</b>.”
This refers to the unification of the Holy One blessed be He and the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i> as revealed
by the three letters of the Hebrew alphabet 999 in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira
Yesod</span></i>, because when the two pieces of wood, the wood of
Yosef and the wood of Judah, are combined into “one in My hand, ”
that is, in the hand of God, then truth is redeemed up to the level
of “like a bridegroom’s rejoicing over his bride” [Isa. 62:5],
i.e., the Redemption is completed. The plain meaning is that unity
refers to unification with the Holy One Blessed be He. After rising
all the previous six levels, it is possible to attain the level of
the unification of the Holy One Blessed be He with the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>,

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">C. On the extent of miraculous
help from Heaven at the time of the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>.
The help of Heaven in general, and miracles in particular, are a
matter of measure for measure. Heaven measures a man as he measures
his fellow man. That means that Heaven aids a person similarly to how
that person practically and naturally fulfills a commandment. It is
done level for level on the basis of 499 1/2 from the left, and 499
1/2 on the right, as explained by the Gaon in many places (especially
in his compositions <i>Yahel Or</i>, and “The Luster of the Dawn”).
One may ask, “How is it possible to act at the beginning, even more
so to take a risk in doing something with the expectation of a 50%
natural, 50% miraculous outcome, since to begin with, we do not
depend on a miracle?” But the accounting is such that the
miraculous aspect constitutes a higher percentage of the outcome than
the other aspects. Now when it comes to deeds concerning the
footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
especially deeds performed by the community, the Gaon maintains that
Heaven’s miraculous help is far greater than the measure for
measure account. At times, the help of heaven is 1000 times greater. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The account is considered as
follows: the highest level of awakening from below, both in what is
possible and in what each individual member of the community has to
reach and achieve in practice regarding repairs and for salvation, is
the level of 999 in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Yesod</span></i>
(<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Likutei Hagr’a</span></i>),
that is, until the level of “1000 lakes” as is known. The phrase
“1000 lakes” hints at the gematria and the might of the two
[499x2] hosts, as the Gaon explains in many places, which nest in the
sefirot <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Netzach</span></i> and
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Hod</span></i>. <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Netzach</span></i>
and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Hod</span></i> represent the
two legs of the cypress tree level where the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>
are found. The level of the last 1000 is completed by the small aleph
in the ! Ze’er Anpin, as revealed by the verse: “the smallest
[will become] a thousand” [Isa. 60:22]. This completes the number
500 on each side, and they are in the two sefirot <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Netzach</span></i>
and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Hod</span></i>. He (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Netzach</span></i>)
is concealed in the letter ‘vau’; she (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Hod</span></i>)
is concealed in the letter ‘heh’ of the Holy Name. Accordingly,
every level on the left line which is Dinim, is immediately joined by
the same level on the right side, which is miraculous <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>.
Now when the deed is performed in public, then the personal merit of
each person according to the root of his soul from the middle line,
the line of Mercy, is added to the merit of the entire group. This is
especially true when the exiles are being gathered in, about which it
states: “with abundant mercy I will gather you in.”</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">After all this, the last level
of the awakening from below is reached, that is, the level of 999
steps, which is the perfection of 999 in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira
Yesod</span></i> of three worlds, and its completion by the small
aleph. Immediately afterwards, the upper abundance of the great Aleph
of the <i>Arich Anpin</i> is added, in which case each Aleph is a
thousand times greater than the entire lower aleph, the small aleph
of the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, where <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> nests (two friends who do not separate). All
this is accomplished with the upper abundance and miraculously. As
known, the blessing of God comes from the abundance of the Great God,
as expressed in the verse: “May God increase you a thousandfold and
bless you” [Deut. 1:11], etc. This also explains the figures in the
verse: “one will chase a thousand” [Deut. 32:30].</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">D. Similarly, it must be known
and remembered that the forces of impurity, the <i>klipot</i> layers
of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>
also have levels of 499 1/2 on the right and 499 1/2 on the left as
noted in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Zohar</span></i>
(see , p. 27). They are called “the muddy valley.” When they
reach the final levels, God forbid, they can attain all the power of
Esau and Ismael (the ox and donkey of impurity) together, and destroy
the entire world. However, God made one to counter the other: to
counter the forces of impurity are the great forces of the same
levels of holiness of the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>--the
holy ox and donkey. They have the same number 499 1/2 on one side and
499 1/2 on the other side, as explained above. The holy ones
counterattack, etc. They stand against the impure forces like an iron
wall and fortified city. These are the “horns of the ox” at the
opening of the city, on the middle line in the gates of Jerusalem on
the west, where the fortress of Joseph’s angel will be in the war
against the angel of Esau. There, “will gore nations together, to
the ends of the earth” [Deut. 33:17].</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">E. “There is <b>hope</b> for
your future” (Jer. 31:16). At first glance, the verse seems
difficult, for hope generally applies at the beginning of something,
not at its end. How is Rachel comforted by a statement that at the
end there will be only hope? What kind of ultimate salvation is hope
alone? The answer is that in this case the letters mean that the
Redemption will be completed on the level of the great 1000 from the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Da'at</span></i>,
by 500 [in gematria] in ‘vau’ and 500 in ‘heh’. At first this
occurs at the awakening from below as explained above (note of the
copyist: as explained in the commentary of the Gaon in the book <i>Yahel
Or</i> on <i><span style="font-weight: normal">parsha</span></i><i>t</i>
“<i>Mishpatim</i>, ” and also in the book <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Likutei
Hagr’a</span></i> , p. 27, and the commentary <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Be’er
Yitzchak</span></i> there, and in many other places in the Gaon’s
commentaries), when the two armies are taken hold of: 499 1/2 on the
right and 499 1/2 on the left or, altogether 999, which is 1000 minus
1. At that point the level of the thousand is completed by the
abundance from above of the great thousand from the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Da'at</span></i>, and 500 is
completed on each side as well as above and below. This is what it
means by “in your future, ” that is, as explained above, your
completion will be **. When will this happen? After your children
return to their border, as is written there [Jer. 31:17]. </font>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">F. With all our might in deed
and gematria we must draw the upper abundance of Redemption power
from the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>
of the great thousand until the end of the awakening-from-below
level, as noted above. And the ‘vau’ will descend toward the
‘heh’ as stated in the holy <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Zohar</span></i>,
until their measurements equal 499 1/2 on the right and 499 1/2 on
the left on the level of and with the power of two periods [of time]
in the sense of the verse: “her period has been completed” [Isa.
40:2] in Jerusalem. At this point the two levels are reached equally:
the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Din</span></i>
and the quality of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Chesed</span></i>
in the <i>sefirot</i> <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Netzach</span></i>
and <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Hod</span></i>, at the base
of the cypress over God’s footstool. Then Jerusalem is at a stage
of equality precisely as revealed in the words “make my legs like
those of rams and their legs a straight leg with equal numbers on the
right, on the left, above and below. This refers to the ‘vau’ and
‘heh’ of the holy name which contain the two <i><span style="font-weight: normal">meshichim</span></i>,
who unite in one all-inclusive number: 1000 minus 1. Immediately, the
upper abundance of the great Aleph descends through the agency of
Moshe Rabbeinu, may he rest in peace, who is the final redeemer who
completes the number 1000, as revealed in the words: [Song 8:12] “the
thousand is yours, who completes it.” Similarly, in gematria the
words <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
+ <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben
David</span></i> equal 1000 [566 + 434]. This is the secret of the
ingathering of exiles coming first from the North. Similarly with
regard to every mitzvah and especially so every instance of salvation
for Israel in general, all the forces and special upper attributes
are drawn from above to below in this manner, by lifting and raising
the lower, natural force to the final level of 499 1/2 on the left
till that same level is reach on the right line with the help of God
by means of the middle line, which is the line of mercy, through the

smallest will become a thousand</span></span> and the youngest a
mighty nation; I am the Lord; in its time, I will hasten it” [Isa.
60:22]. Our sages understood the words “in its time I will hasten
it” to refer to two ways. If they the people [of Israel] are
worthy, I will hasten in; if they are not worthy, it will occur at
its predetermined time. In neither case does the Biblical verse lose
its literal meaning, that when the time comes, I will hasten it. When
will this occur? When the youngest becomes a thousand, that is, when
we ourselves reach the level of the small thousand, at the awakening
from below, and the youngest becomes a mighty nation. The smallest
and youngest is Efraim, who is <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> whose mission is the ingathering of exiles. A
mighty nation refers to the number 600, 000; then, even though its
time has come, I will hasten it [the process]. This is the middle

the Redemption of Truth and Sanctification of God</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">We must strengthen ourselves to
promote the Redemption, that is, the redemption of the truth and
sanctification of God according to the Gaon’s commentary on the
following verses: “for every eye will see when God returns to Zion”
[Isa. 82:8]. This refers to the ingathering of exiles. “Break out
in joy, sing together, O ruins of Jerusalem” [Isa. 52:9] refers to
the rebuilding of Jerusalem and removing the impure spirit from the
land. “For the Lord has comforted his People, He has redeemed
Jerusalem” [Isa. 52:9] refers to the redemption of the truth, since
Jerusalem is referred to as the City of Truth in “God has uncovered
His holy arm before the eyes of all the nations” [Isa. 52:10], etc.
This refers to sanctifying God, as the words of the prophecy
indicate, and as written in the continuation of the verse: “the
ends of the earth will see the salvation of God.” These verses hint
at Israel’s victory in the War of Gog and Magog by <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i>, according to the Gaon (comment of the copyists:
in the book Likutei Agadot, p.15, 53”), the war of Gog and Magog
will take place after the first redemption from oppression by the
monarchies. According to the above explanation, it seems clear that
preparation for the great victory is by redemption of the Truth and
sanctification of God.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">This helps us understand well
the words of the Gaon in his chapter on “The Mystery of the
[Hebrew] Letters, ” that during the period of the ingathering of
the exiles, the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>
will become stronger (comments of the copyist: in <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Likutei
Hagr’a</span></i> “the secret of the Letters, p. 40, the
commentary “<i>Be’er Yitzchak</i>” brings the Gaon’s comment
that the verse: “the redeemed of the Lord will return” refers to
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben Yosef</span></i>
who is the first redeemer, through whose agency the ingathering of
exiles will be accomplished. Then, during the footsteps of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>, the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> will be most powerful). The main desire of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> is to uproot the truth, and this is what is meant by
the verse: “Esau hates Jacob, ” because Jacob is in the line of
truth, as is written “give Truth to Jacob.” The <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> knows that the goal is redemption of the truth and
sanctification of God. which occur along with the ingathering of the
exiles and rebuilding Jerusalem as explained above. The <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> also knows that as the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
progress, so the end of the power of impurity nears. He therefore
girds himself with all his strength and power to wage his battle to
uproot the truth and every good deed that leads to sanctification of
God. We can thus understand what our Sages meant by their comments on
the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
(<i>Sota</i>, 49b) where the Talmud states: “during the footsteps
of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
truth will be missing and brazenness will be blatant, a son will
disgrace his father, and the young will shame the elders. Why will
all this occur, especially during the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
more or than in another period? For the redemption of the truth and
sanctification of God are the goals of the redemption along with the
ingathering of the exiles and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Therefore,
during the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>
exerts himself more powerfully in his war to root out the truth. The
word missing -- “the truth will be missing” means that it will
have been uprooted according to the order of the Hebrew alphabet
[this means that the order is : first is the first letter, then the
last letter, then the second letter, then the next to the last
letter, etc.] According to that order, the of the word can be
exchanged for . Thus during the final footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
the amount of ingratitude and requiting evil for good will become
greater than ever since the creation of the world. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The term “during the
footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
” which is used by our Sages, should be interpreted literally:
during the time of the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
and at its high point, i.e., at the height of the activities at the
beginning of the Redemption — primarily the ingathering of the
exiles, rebuilding Jerusalem, redemption of Truth and sanctification
of God’s name, as noted above--during this time the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> will become more powerful in attempting to disturb
and precipitate failure by uprooting the truth and preventing
sanctification of God. This is what is meant by “who taunted the
footsteps of Your <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
[Ps. 89:52]”</font></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i> that he

of Ismael; from the eyes of our forefather Isaac, the <i>klipa</i> of
Esau; and from the eyes of our forefather Jacob, the <i>klipa</i> of
the <i>terafim</i>. During the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>
becomes even stronger, in order to strike Biblical scholars with
blindness.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">All this is obligatory upon us
to know and understand beforehand, when we carry out our holy work of
gathering in the exiles and rebuilding Jerusalem. We must know
beforehand that to the extent that this holy work will increase--so
the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra Achra</span></i>’s
power to disturb and bring about failure will increase with his
primary weapon which is eradicating the truth as explained above by
our Sages and the Gaon. If we know all this ahead of time-- the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i>’s desire and the force of his warfare, then we
will know how to deal with it practically. We will know how to fight
him, measure for measure. That is, the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> wishes to uproot Truth and to bring about
desecration of God name, and we will fight him by redemption of the
truth and sanctification of God-s name. This is also what is meant by
the verse: “God wages war against Amalek from generation to
generation” [Ex. 17:16]. The forces of God’s seal is that truth
will give us the strength as we proceed step by step in our war. We
must remember that this power comes miraculously from Heaven
according to our Sages (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>
64a); in the incident when a note fell from Heaven, they state that
“truth was written on it, which is the seal of God.” But in every
commandment the awakening from below is required. About this it says
“the truth will sprout from the land” [Ps. 85:12]. When we act on
behalf of redemption of Truth from below, then God will aid us with
His imprint, and since the main center of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sitra
Achra</span></i> is in the gates of Jerusalem, as it says “come to
its gates; cast lots on Jerusalem” (Ovadia 1:11), and as it states:
“sin crouches at the entrance” against the “entrance to the
city” of Jerusalem, because all the desire of the impure force is
to attach itself to the center of Holiness. It says about this: “God
will denounce you O Satan...He who chooses Jerusalem” [Zach. 3:2].
Therefore here at the gates of the holy city of Jerusalem, may it be
built and established, is the site and center for the supreme force

for the Messiah of the Beginning, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>

has seven aspects. The first stage commenced in the year 5500 (1740),
the beginning of the first &quot;hour&quot; of daylight of the 6th
millennium. [As the Gaon taught, the events of this first hour are
alluded to in the sixth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy (<i>Ki

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">It is there, at the end of <i>Ki
Tetze</i> that the great mission of our master, the Gaon is alluded
to. First, the Gaon found a hint to his own name in the verse, &quot;You
shall retain a perfect and just weight...&quot; (Deuteronomy 25:15).
Immediately following this, it is written, &quot;You shall blot out
the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens&quot; (25:19), and

inheritance, you shall occupy and settle it...&quot; (26:1). </font>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The next stage will signal the
beginning of the 7th-century of the sixth millennium, and will
commence in the year 5600 (1840). From this point on, the messianic
revelation will actually begin. This involves the mystery of [a
progressive revelation of] the Higher Wisdom, together with [a
parallel elevation of] the Lower Wisdom. The [acceleration of this
messianic revelation] is dependent on our stimulation from below.
This, in turn, is intimately related with the natural evolution of
scientific knowledge. All of this is in accord with the [prophecy of
the] holy <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Zohar</span></i>
(<i>VaYeira</i> 117a): &quot;In the six hundredth year of the sixth
millennium the gates of wisdom above, together with the wellsprings

(1840 C.E.) and onwards, [the period of] &quot;the call of the

(1809), [in accord with the verse], &quot;Ephraim, My firstborn&quot;
(Jeremiah 31:8). With this, the first stimulation of the &quot;morning
light,&quot; referred to by the sages, has been implemented. It is
this beginning stimulation that will bring the &quot;time to favor
her&quot; closer. This is the mission of the first Messiah, the
Messiah of the Beginning, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>
<i>ben Yoseph</i>. He will do this in the same way that Ezra and
Nehemiah [brought the Jews home] during the reign of Cyrus during the
days of the [rebuilding] of the Second Temple. Our master, the Gaon,
made numerous references to this [task of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>

master's mission was in the illumination of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>

of blessing that can be bestowed upon the people of Israel and the
Land of Israel is, &quot;[God] will grant you ascendancy above all
the nations that He has made, for praise, fame, and beauty&quot;
(26:19). Mankind will only acknowledge the ascendancy of Israel's
[wisdom], however, when it will become known that that wisdom is none

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">4. With regard to the
superiority of Israel's wisdom, our master, the Gaon, explained:
Whenever the terms &quot;praise and fame&quot; or &quot;praise&quot;
[alone] are mentioned [in the Bible] in conjunction with Israel or
the Land of Israel, they refer specifically to Israel's wisdom as [it
will be] seen by the entire world. For example: </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">a. Regarding Jerusalem, the
verse states: &quot;O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen on your walls.
They will never be silent day or night. [They say:] 'You who make
mention of God, take no rest. And give Him no rest until He
establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise on earth'&quot; (Isaiah
62:6-7). A literal interpretation of this verse indicates that the
rebuilding of Jerusalem will evoke admiration and praise. According
to what we have said, however, the verse is also referring to the
praise that Israel's wisdom will evoke when it is re-centered in a
rebuilt Jerusalem. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">

the exiles the verse states: “‘At that time I will make your fame
and praise [known] among all the peoples of the world, when I restore
your captivity before your eyes,’ says the Lord&quot; (Zephaniah
3:20). “Fame and praise” refers to the wisdom of Israel that will
be revealed before the eyes of the entire world. As explained above,
this will occur in conjunction with the ingathering of the exiles. </font>

forth its growth, and the garden causes its seeds to spring forth, so
the Lord will cause [Israel's] righteousness and praise to spring
forth before all the nations&quot; (Isaiah 61:11). As the context of
this verse indicates, the recognition and praise of Israel's wisdom
is intimately bound up with the re-flourishing of the Land of Israel.

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">d. Regarding the revelation of
the inner teachings of the Torah, the verse states: &quot;She [the

and Understanding (<i>Binah</i>) refer specifically to the secrets of
the Torah, as is known to those initiated into the esoteric wisdom.
The inner teachings of the Torah are the very source of Israel's
excellence and [the means by which they can achieve] their most
elevated status. Again, this is the intention of the verse: &quot;[God]
will grant you ascendancy above all the nations that He has made, for
praise, fame, and glory.&quot; As explained, it is Israel's wisdom
that will be praised and elevated in the eyes of the nations. In
connection with this, our master added a fitting allusion: [the
phrase] &quot;for praise and fame&quot; (<i>LeTehilla U'leShem</i> =
846) is numerically equivalent to [the phrase] &quot;Seven Sciences&quot;
(<i>Sheva Chochmot</i> = 846). </font>

[progressive] revelation of the wisdom of the Torah. This refers, in
particular, to the revelation of the secret wisdom of the Torah and
the [parallel] opening of the seven wisdoms above by virtue of [our]
stimulation from below. This is the meaning of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Zohar</span></i>'s

great need he felt for sanctifying [the Name of] God in the eyes of
the nations? [How] many times did he say, amidst heavy sighing, &quot;Why
is it said among the nations, 'Where is the wisdom of Israel?'&quot;
Time and again he would confide in us [saying], &quot;Are the bearers
of our Torah working for the sanctification of God's [Name], as did
Israel's great leaders of the past? Many of them sanctified the Name
of Heaven with their extensive knowledge in the investigation of the
mysteries of nature, of the wonders of the Blessed Creator's
[wisdom]. As a result, many righteous gentiles publicly extolled the
wisdom of Israel and its Torah sages. [Among these sages were] the
members of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>,
the Tanaim, the Amoraim, etc. In later generations, [these were
followed by] our master, Maimonides, and the author of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tosafot</span></i>

is the foundation principle of the entire creation. It is the
supernal light of Divine Wisdom itself. All the upper and lower
universes and all that are in them [emanate from this Light and are

through the universe of Emanation (Atzilut), all the spiritual and

from the transcendent and holy power of the Light of Supernal Wisdom.
It is their fractal sparks (<i>nitzotzin</i>) that descend from above
to below until reaching the dimension of Action (<i>Asiyah</i>),
where they become materialized in the lower world. This is true of
every single property, in general and in particular, each according
to its respective source and line of connection. All natural
phenomena of the external world thus derive from the power of the
Light of Supernal Wisdom. Their essential properties descend from
above to below and are concentrated into seven compartments. This is
the meaning of the verse, &quot;Wisdoms have built her house; her
hewn pillars are seven&quot; (Proverbs 9:1). This is referring to the
Seven Sciences that interpenetrate [and flow through] the Seven
Pillars of the world, as is known. </font>

Light of Supernal Wisdom through a subtle channel (<i>tzinor</i>).
This is the mystery of [the verse], &quot;He suspends the world upon
no-thingness (<i>beli-mah</i>)&quot; (Job 26:7). This [channel in
Ezekiel's vision] is the mystery of the thread of Radiance (<i>Nogah</i>)
and the appearance of the Electrum (<i>Chashmal</i>). [<i>Chashmal</i>
is thus] an acronym for <i>Chochmah Shel Ma'alah</i> (Wisdom from
above). All of these [levels in turn] derive from their original root
in the blessed light of the Infinite One (<i>Ohr Ain Sof, Barukh Hu</i>).

of eighteen. News spread that a number of anti-Semitic Ukrainian
priests were preaching inflammatory sermons in their churches against
the Jews. Drawing on false libels that had no basis in fact, they
denigrated the ethical conduct and material life of the Jews. One of
the priests in the city of Kiev was a Jewish apostate, who spoke out
of hatred for his own people. Among other outrages he declared, &quot;The
Jews think of themselves as a wise and understanding people. With
what are they wise? They swindle and conspire against the gentiles in
order to exploit them.&quot; The words of the priest stirred up great
waves [of hatred] among the masses who heard him. In the wake of this
foreboding news, the heads and leaders of our community in Shklov
gathered to confer on what course of action to take in order to
forestall any evil. Individuals were chosen from the leaders of the
community: my father R. Benyamin [Rivlin], R. Yehoshua Zeitlin, my

be fulfilled: 'She is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes
of the nations.' And they will proclaim [the concluding words of the
verse,] 'This great nation is surely a wise and understanding

Hebrew grammar. [By mastering this wisdom] he also hoped to achieve
an even greater understanding of the secrets of the Torah. He used to
say that all that had been revealed [in previous generations] and all
that was being revealed [now] through natural research was no more
than a drop in the ocean compared to what was [still] concealed in
the wisdom of the Torah, and which will be revealed in the future
together with the teachings of the righteous <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>.
Nevertheless, this wisdom would be revealed to select individuals
&quot;little by little&quot; during the period of Ikveta DiM’shecha.

others. [Concerning medicine,] he once discussed the sublime concepts
contained in the verse, &quot;But for you who fear My name, the sun
of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings...&quot;

understood that] the essence of his dream and vision [concerned these
two levels]. He therefore saw it as an indication of his great
mission: he was to become the conduit (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Yesod</span></i>)
for [revealing the supernal] Chochmah and Binah. This is why he later
said to Pharaoh, &quot;Now Pharaoh must seek out a man who is

place prior to the giving of the Torah [which is the level of the

the verse: &quot;She is your wisdom and your understanding in the

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">When Yoseph had recounted his
dreams to his brothers, he made sure to include their
interpretations, namely, that they indicated his superior

their jealousy, as the verse states: &quot;They hated him even more
for his dreams and for his words&quot; (Genesis 37:8). &quot;His

this: [the phrase] &quot;my sheaf arose&quot; (<i>kama alumati</i> =

(<i>Sheva Chochamot</i> = 481). Our master revealed another amazing
allusion [that indicates Yoseph's link with &quot;wisdom and
understanding”]. During the Exodus from Egypt, &quot;Moses took
Yoseph's bones with him, for Yoseph had bound the children of Israel
by an oath, saying, 'God will surely redeem you; you shall therefore
bring my bones out of here with you'&quot; (Exodus 13:19)]. The

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Our master wrote extensively on
the laws of Hebrew grammar in his holy works on the Kabbalah. In
addition, as mentioned, he composed separate works on the theory of
grammar and the wisdom [that is contained in biblical Hebrew]. He
admonished us concerning the absolute necessity and importance of
this study: firstly, for the sake of precision, and secondly, in
order to grasp the wisdom of the Torah and the fundamental principles
of creation [that are embedded in it]. It is known [from the Gaon's
writings] that all the details of creation are included in the Torah.
The totality of the wisdom of the Torah is hidden, in turn, in the
mystery of its [22] letters and [10] vowel points. This is the
meaning of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Zohar</span></i>
's statement that &quot;God gazed into the Torah and created the
world.&quot; Similarly, the sages taught that [in engineering the
construction of the Sanctuary in the wilderness] &quot;Betzalel knew
how to combine the letters with which the heavens and the earth were
created.&quot; This combination (<i>tzeruf</i>) of the Hebrew letters
is accomplished primarily through knowledge of the rules of grammar
and vowel points. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">A supernal and majestic wisdom
is hidden within the theory of Hebrew grammar. Even the simplest
level of construction of the Holy Tongue manifests a wondrous and
divine wisdom. This is evident in its brevity of expression, as well
as in its root structure and paradigms. The wisdom of Hebrew grammar
is the transcendental soul of our holy language, the language of our
Torah. It is the language of the Living God and the language of the
ministering angels. It is for this reason that the teachings of the
Kabbalah repeatedly refer to the mystery of the [22] letters and the
[10] vowels points. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">As mentioned in <i>Sod
Kedoshim</i>, speaking in the Holy Tongue actually gives pleasure to
the Creator. We express this idea in our prayers when we say, &quot;[The
ministering angels] sanctify their Creator; they cause Him pleasure
with their pure speech and sweet melody.&quot;60 [This pleasure] is
compounded when the Holy Tongue is spoken in the Land of Israel, as
per the Midrash, &quot;One who dwells in the Land of Israel, speaks
the Holy Tongue, and eats his everyday food (chulin) in a state of
ritual purity, is guaranteed an inheritance in the World to Come.” </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Regarding the gravity of
grammatical precision, the Talmud says, &quot;One who recites the
Shema must be careful to pronounce each letter [properly].&quot; The
reason for this is that the world itself was created with this holy
language. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Thus, one who is immersed in
the Hebrew language and knows the secrets of its grammatical rules

requirement to speak the Holy Tongue, it is equally important to know
its cantellation notes and its laws of grammar. </font>

the period leading to the construction of the Second Temple in accord
with the mission of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben
Yosef</span></i>. The beginning of the Redemption is the time of the
Revealed End, when the following seven pillars are hewn: 1) gathering
in the exiles; 2) building Jerusalem; 3) eradicating the impure
spirit from Eretz Israel by planting the Holy Land and fulfilling the
commandments related to it; 4) setting up people of truth in order to
redeem the truth and sanctify the name of God; 5) promoting the
spread of Torah from Zion; 6) waging war against Amalek; 7) healing
Zion. We, the emissaries of the Almighty, are obligated to do our
utmost to carry out these goals as revealed by “deed and gematria
[numerology].” </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">We must act modestly, along the
lines of the Vilna Gaon’s major rule that anything that will be
achieved upon completion of the Redemption will start at the
beginning of the Redemption little by little, with Ze’er Anpin. In
addition, we must study the teachings regarding the footsteps of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>, as
described in the 156 qualities and aspects of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> [see above Chapter 2], in order to know how the
holy work is carried out, so as not to retreat, God forbid, when
faced with obstacles and <i>sanballatim</i> [see Neh. 2:19; 3:33-34].
All this is the mission of the Rabbi Eliyahu, the Vilna Gaon, and at
his directive. May his merit and blessing help us in all our paths,
and may God complete the task for us.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The Gaon always spoke about an
important rule, that all deeds of the beginning of the Redemption,
when the awakening comes from below — “all will be like the
period of the Second Temple, ” like the days of “Ezra and
Nehemiah when permission was granted by <i>Coresh</i>.”</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">All seven principles of work to
be accomplished during the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>,
and the details of the deeds, are part of the beginning of the
revealed end, as noted by our Sages in the Talmud (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megillah</span></i>
17b), concerning the juxtaposition of blessings to the events that
follow. The promise of blessings, and the ideas of gathering in the
exiles, building Jerusalem and eradicating the spirit of impurity
from Eretz Israel follow one another in the Bible. As is written:
“you, mountains of Israel, will give forth your branch and bear
your fruit for My people, Israel, when they are about to come” [Ez.
36:8]. The Talmud (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i>
98a} writes that this verse refers to the Revealed End. The Revealed
End was the major energizing and strong aspiration of the Vilna Gaon
and his students. The entire matter of the revealed end is the great
assignment of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben
Yosef</span></i>.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Through the Gaon, may his
memory be blessed, Heaven informed us of this mission which pertains
to the period of the awakening from below. Of course, our mission is
that of the Gaon, the light of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> to the final generation. In the verse: “you,
mountains of Israel, will give forth your branch, ” the Gaon saw a
hint to his name, revealed by “deed and gematria.” The verses
which hint at the Gaon’s mission, and related ones, as well as the
156 appellations and aspects as explained above in Chapter 2, can
teach us much regarding our work. According to the Gaon, we are to
consider the verses and aspects as <i>Urim v’Tumim</i> that inform
us what we must do, with the help of God. Below are the paths of the
beginning of the Redemption practically, at the time of the awakening
from below. The following are the circumstances and manners of
Redemption: </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">1. <b>gathering in the
exiles-how will this occur?</b> To what extent are we, emissaries of
God at the time of the beginning of the Redemption, obligated to
engage in gathering in the exiles? The minimum number of exiles that
has the power to bring back the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>
to Israel is the number our Sages considered when the term
“population of Israel” was used, that is, 600, 000. This number
has the power to vanquish Samael at the gates of Jerusalem. As our
Sages stated concerning God: “For I will not enter Jerusalem above
until the population of Israel enters Jerusalem below” [see Chapter
1, 15].</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">My grandfather (R’ Binyamin)
once asked the Gaon what to do if it becomes possible practically and
naturally to bring all of Israel to the Holy Land at one time.
According to our Sages, if we do not merit it, the Redemption will
come little by little like the dawn. The question is, what should we
do? The Gaon replied: “if it is possible, then 600, 000 should be
brought over at first, because that is the number that can overpower
Samael who rules in the gates of Jerusalem. Then, in any case, the
entire Redemption will occur. The Gaon gave me a wonderful hint
concerning the verse: [Isa. 2:5] “O House of Jacob, come, let us go
in the light of the Lord.” The initial letters of this verse *[# ]*
amount to 60; the word is the same as in gematria; the second letters
of the words in this verse [156] equal in gematria. The final letters
of this verse [618] equal “the heart of Jerusalem.” Thus this
verse hints that the words “come, let us go” refers to going to
Zion together with 600, 000 people, and all are connected to “the
heart of Jerusalem.” The Biblical verse does not even lose its
literal meaning, that all must be in the light of God, that is with
the internal soul of the Holy Torah. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">What is the number necessary to
begin gathering in the exiles? Even one from a city or two from a
family [Jer. 3:14]. From where should the ingathering begin? From the
North, as is written: “behold I will bring them from the land of
the north, etc. (Jer. 31:7), because the main ruling power of Samael
is on the northern side, and Samael is referred to as “the northern
one.” It says about him: “I will distance the northern one from
you” [Joel 2:20]. And he is the one who drew the main part of the
exile of Israel to the north, as noted: “out of the North, evil
will break forth” [Jer. 1:14]. Therefore, the beginning of the
ingathering of the exiles must also be from the place ruled by
Samael, from the North. Thus it is written, “awake, you from the
North, ” and afterwards it states, “come, you from the South”
[Song, 4:16]. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">2. <b>building Jerusalem</b>.
How will this be accomplished? To what extent are we obligated to act
to accomplish this during the awakening from below? Our Rabbis said
that in the future Jerusalem will expand as far as Damascus. In the
future Jerusalem will extend as far as the Great Sea (the
Mediterranean). The procedure will be gradual. Our Sages maintained
that the redemption of Israel will be like the first rays of the
dawn: just as the dawn comes gradually, so will Israel’s settlement
come gradually, and likewise with regard to building it, etc. The
building will be accomplished even in poverty, as is written: “that
God has established Zion and the poor of His people take shelter in
it” (Isa. 14:32). The building will start from even one stone:
“behold I am laying a foundation stone in Zion, a tried stone, ”
because God wishes to put us through a severe trial, by building Zion
from even a single stone, and this “will be a precious cornerstone,
a secure foundation” [Isa. 28:16], etc.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Our work consists of fulfilling
the commandment of expansion: “expand the site of your tent”
[Isa. 54:2]. “The commandment of expansiveness” means ‘expand,
do not restrain yourselves’. The verse teaches us that we must not
stand still; we must not retreat, God forbid, when confronting any
obstacle. Yet another verse, connected with the commandment of
expansion, hints at the name of the Gaon; as known, for in gematria
the verse: ! [606] “expand, extend, strengthen” together equal !
[the name of the Gaon together with his father’s name]. In that
same chapter it states [Isa. 54:7] [ 606] “with abundant mercy I
will gather you.” The term “I will gather you” is the great
mission of the Gaon, as explained above in chapters 1 and 3.
According to our Sages, the method used should be the <b>equally
measured gardens</b> [<i>Baba Batra</i> 75b] mentioned in connection
with the building and settlement of Jerusalem. Practically, there
should be complete equality on the line of equality for all, as
explained in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Tosafot</span></i>
concerning the building of Jerusalem. This approach is also included
in the Gaon’s principle regarding the verse “a perfect and just
stone, ” another verse in which the Gaon saw a hint to his own
name. There it states that there should not be two kinds of
measurement in one’s home: “a large one and a small one” [Deut.
25:14]. According to the Gaon, the term ‘home’ refers to the land
of Israel, because immediately after this verse it states, “when
the Lord your God grants you rest ** in the land [Deut. 25:19], etc.”
Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes, and houses are not to be
rented in Jerusalem. Also, <i><span style="font-weight: normal">ben
David</span></i> will not come until all measurements are equal, and
all prices are equal.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Another point made by the Gaon
is that when we build Jerusalem, we are obligated to fulfill all the
means of inheriting, including literally taking it by force if
necessary, except in the case of building the Temple. Force must not
be used to build the Temple, the Gaon says in his commentary on the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Song of Songs</span></i>.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">What should be built first? The
northwestern section of Jerusalem should be built first; from the
peak of <i>Amana</i> because <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> comes from the North, and the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>
is in the West.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">3. <b>eradicating the impure
spirit from Eretz Israel by planting the Holy Land.</b> The three
groups of exiles depend on this, according to the Gaon, especially
the commandments concerning leaving the poor man the gleanings of the
crop, the forgotten sheaf, and the corners of the field.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">How much should be planted and
to what extent? The land should be planted until it is no longer
desolate, until the holy land bears its fruit. The goal is to drive
out the spirit of impurity from the land, to purify the holiness of &quot;
the Revealed God from its klipah, etc. The holiness of the Revealed
God rests upon the fruits of the Holy Land. This is the secret of the
reason for the commandments “when you come to the land you shall
plant...” [Lev. 19:23]. According to the Midrash, you should not
occupy yourself with anything except planting û this is the main
part of the mission of the Vilna Gaon in connection with the verse “a
perfect and just stone” which hints at his name in the Torah. For
following the verse is the command to wipe out the name of Amalek.
Afterwards the Torah discusses obligations “when you come to the
land” [Deut. 26:1]. The verse in Deuteronomy “when you come to
the Land” is reminiscent of the comparative verse: “when you come
to the land, you shall plant” [Lev. 19:23]; therefore the
commandments are connected. The Gaon revealed to us that this
wonderful idea is the main secret regarding the revealed end
mentioned in the Talmud. It was the energizing aspiration of the
Gaon. Our Sages speak of the revealed end in connection with the
verse: [Ez. 36:8] “you, mountains of Israel, will give forth your
branch and bear your fruit for My People, etc.” The Gaon considered
this verse to hint at his own holy mission.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The planting of the land is one
of the duties of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach ben

mountain of the Lord” [Ps. 24:3], etc.; “you will have mercy on
Zion” [Ps. 102:14], etc.; “you will have favored her dirt” [Ps.
102:15], as explained above in chapters 1 and 3. Also above, the
mission of the Gaon is mentioned as being in the line of <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">4. <b>setting up people of
truth in order to redeem the truth and sanctify the name of God.
</b>While we are on the threshold of the Redemption, we must set up a
powerful and strong force of people of truth, for Jerusalem was
destroyed because truthful people had ceased to exist there.
Accordingly, God forbid, there will be no permanence to our work in
gathering in the exiles and building Jerusalem unless we set up
truthful men, as is written, “if God does not build a house, its
builders have worked in vain” [Ps. 127:1]. This means that if a
building was not built with the spirit of God, then its builders
worked in vain. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The people of truth should be
people of Israel [chosen by God, i.e., Israel, as in Isa. 45:4 “and
Israel My chosen one”], men of truth, because the goal of the
Redemption is redemption of the truth, as explained above regarding
“redeemer of Jerusalem.” This means that there will be a city of
truth because of the truthful people. The fundamental base of
truthful men is to ensure fulfillment all the principles found in
“the Interpreter’s seven repairs” as explained in Chapter 5
above, to ensure the repairs according to the “covenant of truth”
[Neh. 10:1] that we arranged with the help of God. The presence of
faithful [truthful] and righteous men is included among the principal
characteristics of the Revealed End mentioned in the Talmud (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megillah</span></i>
17b; <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Sanhedrin</span></i> 98a).
Jerusalem is the source for the specialness of people of Truth in all
aspects; it is therefore referred to as a “City of Truth” [Isa.
1:26].</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The purpose of the redemption
of the truth is sanctification of God’s name. The purpose of
sanctifying God’s name is repair of the world in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">sefira</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i> of the
Almighty, so that each person should merit achieving the holy spirit
that every man of Israel is obligated to draw upon and achieve in
clear colors. This is the main goal of all the activities of the
beginning of the Redemption during the footsteps of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i>.All
the deeds mentioned here, all their principles and details, even
minor ones, are only to prepare for the main principles of the
revealed end, that the end of the Redemption should come nearer, that
is the repair of the world in the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Malchut</span></i>
of the Almighty. Then the complete and perfect repair will be
accomplished of the seven areas requiring repairs, as explained by
the Interpreter above in Chapter 5, and as explained by the Gaon in
his composition, *&quot;* The Luster of the Dawn. </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">5. <b>promoting the spread of
Torah from Zion.</b> Studying the teachings of the Kabbalah and
uncovering the secrets of the Torah during the footsteps of the
<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach</span></i> are primary
in bringing the Redemption closer, as explained by the Gaon at length
in a few places. This is one of the main goals of the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Mashiach
ben Yosef</span></i> who is in charge of gathering in the exiles, the
assignment of the Gaon. Such studies should take place especially in
Eretz Israel in general, and in Jerusalem in particular. This is what
is meant by “the Torah will come forth from Zion” [Isa. 2:3]: the
Torah will be uncovered; that is the soul, the essence of the Torah
will be revealed in Zion. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Similarly, it is incumbent upon
us to begin by establishing a general institute for studying the
Torah in the Holy City, may this occur in our lifetime, because the
Biblical verse literally states that “the Torah will come forth
from Zion, and the word of God from Jerusalem” [Isa. 2:3]. Our
Rabbis, may they rest in peace, said: In the future all the holy
places of gathering (synagogues) and houses of learning from abroad
will be established in Eretz Israel. This accords with the Gaon’s
important principle, as explained above, that all future things that
will be occur upon completion of the Redemption, will begin little by
little during the beginning of the Redemption. It is what the Gaon
said about the verse: “on the mountains of Zion and in Jerusalem
there will be refuge” [Joel 3:5]. The refuge will be for the
ingathering of the exiles and for our holy Torah. As we say in the
prayer: “for the escape of their scribes.” Accordingly, the
reference to the refuge in Zion and Jerusalem also applies to the
escape of their scribes. In addition, the verse: “I will return
your judges as at first, and your advisers as at the beginning”
[Isa. 1:26], refers to Jerusalem, for at the end it states:
“afterwards, you will be called a city of justice, a city of Truth”
[Isa. 1:26]. This is a major aspect of the Revealed End as it appears
in the Talmud (<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Megillah</span></i>
17b).</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">On the Gaon’s way to Eretz
Israel, with the intention of dwelling in Jerusalem, he told us many
times that that is one of the main holy principles. He also told me
something top secret about the verse: “saying to Jerusalem, ‘you
will be built’; and to the Temple, ‘you will be established’”
[Isa. 44:28], as well as on the verse: [Jer. 31:16] “there is hope
for your end.” In gematria, if we count the filled out letters of
the word [ ** = 611], it equals . This means that at the end, the
Torah will be fulfilled when the children return to their border.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">6. <b>waging war against
Amalek</b>. The war against Amalek is from generation to generation.
The war against Amalek is against three types of foes: a). Amalek of
the heart, that is, the evil inclination and vices; b). the spirit of
Amalek, the general one, the Satan who destroys, the adversary of
Israel. This is Samael and his hosts. His main power is in the gates
of Jerusalem, when its lands are desolate; c). the material Amalek,
that comprises Esau and Ismael and the mixed multitude. As explained
by the Gaon: we are commanded to inherit it [the land] by force. </font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The strength and rulership of
Amalek’s spirit is in the gates of Jerusalem, as mentioned above,
but only when there destruction and desolation near the gates and in
the unwalled areas of Jerusalem. As long as the spirit of impurity
rules there, the feet of the cypress tree cannot stand there. This
delays the connection between the Jerusalem of below and the
Jerusalem of above, that is the connection between the <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Shechina</span></i>
and the Knesset Israel on which the entire Redemption depends. The
war against the desolation is waged not only by setting up tents of
Jacob and dwelling places of Israel in their respective places. It is
waged not only by planting its land and fulfilling the commandments
dependent on it. The war against the material Amalek always depends
on the time and place, and necessitates counterattacking [lit.:
returning the battle to the gate] with force, as in the days of Ezra
and Nechemia, and like the conquest during the days of Joshua. This
is signified by the fact that ! together [391] equal . In the war
against the <i>sanballatim</i> [Sanballat, satrap of Samaria, who
opposed Nehemiah and obstructed the rebuilding of Jerusalem] who
disrupt building in Jerusalem, and whose strength is that of the
mixed multitude, may God save us-in that war, the dweller in Zion
will help us, and “they will neither hurt nor destroy on all My
holy mountain” [Isa. 11:9]. Also, “no weapon formed against you,
will succeed” [Isa. 54:17] as it says “with abundant mercy I will
gather you” [Isa. 54:7]. The last verse also contains the name and
mission of the Gaon, may his merit help all those who occupy
themselves faithfully in such holy work.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 150%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">7. <b>Healing Zion</b>. This
refers to two aspects. Zion is the source of healing as it says “He
will send you help from the Sanctuary and support you from Zion”
[Ps. 20:3]. The term always refers to healing and health as in “will
support him on his sickbed” [Ps. 41:4]. Therefore Zion always needs
the abundance of upper medicine. It is written, “I will heal your
wounds” [Jer. 30:17]. This is one of our Sages’ explanations of
the verse “this is Zion--no one seeks her” [Jer. 30:17]. From
this we learn that Zion requires seekers. “I will heal your wounds”
refers to all kinds of wounds--whether spiritual or material. God
will heal the ailments and repair what is broken, whether spiritually
or of physically. The reference is not only to the people of God who
dwell in Zion, but also to Zion itself, that is the very land of
Eretz Israel, which requires spiritual and physical healing when it
lies desolate and in ruins. The spiritual healing entails eradicating
the spirit of impurity from the land by settling Israel on its land
and fulfilling the commandments that depend on the people of Israel
being in the land. Physical health refers to eradicating the sources
of diseases there, may God save us, during the days of its
destruction and desolation.</font></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Jerusalem is redeemed with
charity, as is written “Zion will be redeemed with justice; and
those who return to her, with righteousness [Isa. 1:27] [in Hebrew,
the term for money given to the poor is ‘ righteousness’ — that
is, the deed is considered a righteous one; in English, the term used
is ‘charity’]. It also says: “You will be established with
righteousness [i.e., charity] and your children’s peace will be
abundant” [Isa. 54:13]. You will be established with charity is
considered both a decree and a sign of grace. God wished to bring
merit to all of Israel, the close ones and those far away, with the
commandment to build Jerusalem. Therefore he decreed that Jerusalem
would be built with charity. Every man of Israel must participate in
the building and expansion of the heritage of God: “expand the site
of your tent” [Isa. 54:2] etc., all the more so during a time and
with commandments connected with Jerusalem and building it. Help in
building Jerusalem is obligatory to compensate for what all Israel in
general and in particular obtain from Jerusalem. Our brethren of
Israel who still reside in the exile receive from their brethren who
dwell in Jerusalem and are building it, thousands even tens of
thousands more than what they contribute to Jersualem, even when the
contribution is generous. For all the abundance of salvation,
blessing, redemption, <span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">lovingkindness</span></span>
and mercy, success, health, etc., etc. of Israel wherever they are,
comes only from Jerusalem and building it.</font></p>
